In his famous essay \"The Death of the Author,\" Roland Barthes states that Mallarme was the first writer in France \"to [...] to be its owner.\"3 The view that the author is the owner of the language is certainly strange and untenable, but there is no reason for us to replace this untenable view with the thesis that language as such is the sole source of meaning in literature. Equally questionable is Barthes\\'s contention that \"once the Author is removed, the claim to decipher a text becomes quite futile,\" since it is based on the mistaken view that \"to give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing,\" as he puts it.4 Barthes\\'s proposal, \"either author or text\" should be replaced by \"both author and text.\" I shall discuss the role of intention and the sense in which works of art are the results of ', 'er of the language is certainly strange and untenable, but there is no reason for us to replace this untenable view with the thesis that language as such is the sole source of meaning in literature. Equally questionable is Barthes\\'s contention that \"[...],\" as he puts it.4 Barthes\\'s proposal, \"either author or text\" should be replaced by \"both author and text.\" I shall discuss the role of intention and the sense in which works of art are the results of human intentions later; for the moment I wish to consider the role of language and experience in understanding and interpreting works of art. What are the requirements for understanding a particular work of art? One requirement, I think, is that we are acquainted with and understand other works of art. Experience of many other things-in particular of lifeis both relevant and necessary. In order to understand a work of art, we do not have to adopt the so-called aesthetic attitude, as is sometimes supposed, and suppress everything we know or th', ' is in circulation, the umbilical cord connecting the text (mirror) to the author (initial polisher) is severed and the text (mirror) gains its independence, ab \\n e to reflect the multiple readers (beholders). Writing, according to Barthes, is “that [...].”143 This is exactly what happens in the mirror and to the Lacanian subject. In this meaning text, like the mirror, can reveal and simultaneously deceive. Furthermore, the different temporality discussed byBarthes has not escaped the perspicacious observance of the Persian Sufi thinker, Hamadānī (discussed succinctly above) in his analogy. Barthes argues: The temporality is different. The Author, when believed in, is always conceived of as the past of his own book: book and author stand automatically on a single line divided into a before and an after. The author is thought to nourish the book, which is to say that he exists before it, thinks, suffers, lives for it, is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his ch', 'speaks us and precedes us, that we cannot write anything truly original or express anything innate but merely arrange readyformed linguistic structures into particular narratives or messages (Robinson): “the writer can only imitate a gesture forever [...] is to combine the different kinds of writing” (Barthes 4). Lacanian theory proposes “that a person’s identity is a product of language, rather than language being a product of a person’s identity,” which takes this idea further in suggesting that human identity itself is a construct (Beville 48). Certainly, in the age of postmodernity, identity is also viewed as something that is gradually constructed by external forces rather than fixed from birth. Emphasizing the role of dominant ideologies in the shaping of individual identity, postmodern theory attends to the relationship between discourse and power in the construction of values, conventions, and norms (Botting 17). Judith Butler, for instance, demonstrated in her writings how identity', ' in context may contain within themselves their own potential for de-contextualization. \"The artist has negated himself\": like Barthes, Tzara sees writing not as the expression of individual voice, but as the destruction of voice. In Barthes\\' words, [...]. 17 For Tzara, the negation of the artist is logically connected to the play of semiosis and the play of intertextuality: \"All poetry is a reshuffling of a pack of picture cards, and all poets are cheats\" (T, p. 53). Even Stoppard himself mirrors Tzara through the intertextual techniques he employs; his conclusions regarding the implications of such artistic reshuffling, however, are significantly different. Stoppard, like Joyce, \"doubles\" the text as a way of affirming the logocentric core of both history and theatrical play, while Tzara sees this logocentrism as an \"overripe corpse,\" the remnant of a religion of literature that must be destroyed: \"Now we need vandals and desecrators, simple-minded demolition men to smash centuries of bar', 'nd creatively shaping her biography to create the impression of herself as a unique, extraordinary individual. Roland Barthes famously sought to reduce the author to a function of the text, claiming in 1968 that the cultural image of literature was ‘[...]’.9 An anti-biographical critical stance is completely unsuited to the case of Akhmatova, who has entered the canon as a biography and personality — a literary celebrity and ‘figure [...] in Russian history’, as Berlin puts it. As this essay shows, the ‘passive resistance’ that he highlights made her a particularly important role model and emblematic figurehead for the Russian intelligentsia. Iconography, Biographical Mythmaking, and the Hagiographic Epitext In his historical study of fame, Leo Braudy observes: To understand why some are remembered with more force than others, we need to investigate the process by which fame becomes a matter of premeditation, a result of media management as much as of achievement, as well as how the great o', 'ries of intertextuality which might challenge its whole conception of the author. Barthes\\'s 1968 essay \"The Death of the Author\" begins with some examination of the way in which writing displaces meaning. Rather than preserving authorial intention, \"[...]\" (168). In Shakespeare in Love , the poet is seen writing his name over and over again - a joke that Barthes might have appreciated. Moreover, Barthes\\'s authorial absence is predicated upon the theory of intertextuality. The text is \"a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash\" (170). Shakespeare in Love has already deployed intertextual theory through its Bloomian representation of Marlowe and Shakespeare. Indeed, it could be said to go beyond Bloom who refiises to accept the relevance of any non-literary context. But how far does Shakespeare in Love go in its challenge to authorial intention?12 Like The Immortal Gentleman and Time Flies , the film is adept at averting threats to author', 'is family from prison, which are then replaced by more 8 mm footage, now of a government ceremony.

Like Roland Barthes\\' ideal text, in which \"[...],\"*6 Northanger Abbey refuses to yield a stable vision, either moral or aesthetic. What it does yield, what it insists upon, is an awareness of the reader\\'s participation in narrative strategies.17 Like Tilney urging Catherine \"to use her own fancy\" in finishing his gothic tale (p. 160), Austen asks the reader to provide part of the story. She says of her closure: \"I have united for their [the readers\\'] ease what they must divide for mine\" (p. 247). In dividing what the author has united, the reader must disentangle the various threads of the novel and repossess the narrative power he normally yields to the author. If the narrator disclaims the responsibility for shaping the reader\\'s view of the world, of books, or even of this book, the re', 'ultural document and event, film encompasses philosophical, sociological, political, and ethical dimensions; it carries class, ethnicity, and gender implications; and it is frequently invested in national identity formation. For Roland Barthes every [...]. . .\"15 Film has become a preferred locus for studying the various ways in which \"many cultures\" enter into a dialogue and separate realms of knowledge compete with each other. To sum up: cultural history (1) examines existing cultural practices and products; (2) it explores the authority of a work (how is it deployed, created, acquired, distributed, transmitted?); (3) it seeks out notions of archive and discourse as entities that deal with film over and above (or together with) genre and authorship; (4) it analyzes the way in which genre convention as well as economic, social, political, ideological, and institutional constraints are incorporated and translated into material and constitutive elements of a text; and (5) it concludes that d', 'gnized. There are, of course, a variety of means by which such a concept of the \"text itself\" may be produced discursively. Barthes argues that the category of the author typically functions in this way. \"To give a text an Author,\" he writes, \"is to [...].\"14 Whatever the details of the devices used, however, a necessary condition for, and complement to, the discursive production of the \"text itself\" consists in the discursive production of a unified subject by whom that text can, even if only tendentially, be recognized.15 12 Texts in History \\n This is as true of Marxist criticism as it is of any other. I argued earlier that the distinguishing hermeneutic gambit of Marxist criticism has consisted in the contention that the objective historical meaning of a text can only be understood by placing it in the context of the originating conditions of its production. The precise way in which this move operates, as well as its consequences, however, are considerably more complicated than this bald', 'y\" text into an already-secondary one that serves as host to an already-secondary text that moves to become, briefly and ironically, primary. We are left, then, with an unstable field of play, a precarious playfulness, a Barthesian termite arena, \"a [...]\" (Barthes 146). 9 , The halt, the hesitation, the Todorovian suspension, the Barthesian bliss, the Derridean absence made present, of cyberspace, opposite of Gibson\\'s frightening external future(-present) of the dark polluted Sprawl, Dog Solitude, Chiba City. From one (yes) perspective, the matrix is an extrapolation of spatial-data management systems studied at MIT, NASA, and elsewhere. From another, it is an idea that came to Gibson while walking down Granville Street in Vancouver. There he saw kids playing in video arcades and noticed \"in the physical intensity of their postures how rapt these kids were. . . . And these kids clearly believed in the space these games projected\" (McCaffery 272). Here the matrix functions as a metaphor for', \"[...], not the author. Roland Barthes The language and gestures of the audience and spectators are coloured more strongly than ever before by the culture industry, even in fine nuances that cannot yet be explained experimentally. Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer Michel Foucault's concept of discourse and discourse analysis underwent many changes, turns and revisions in his writing career and in defence of the provisional and malleable practice of such analysis, Foucault argued that: Discourse is not the majestically unfolding manifestation of a thinking, knowing, speaking subject but on the contrary, a totality, in which the dispersion of the subject and his discontinuity with himself 3 may be determined. Critics have been quick to seize on the\", 'e aspires to the condition of monologue inasmuch as it tries to say the last word on a given subject, to affirm its mastery over all the previous words on that subject\" (94). In \"The Death of the Author,\" Roland Barthes writes in a similar vein: \"To [...]\" (147). In this monological situation, a critic asserts interpretive mastery over a text by reducing a dynamic play of discursive possibilities to the manageable number that can be accounted for by the critic\\'s reading. The analogy to much film criticism should be apparent - as, perhaps, should the applicability of these remarks to our own \"ordinary\" situations as viewers of films. Bakhtin presents \"dialogical\" alternatives to such monological interpretative strategies throughout his work, as in these remarks from his essay \"Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences\": \"Any understanding is a correlation of a given text with other texts. . . . The text lives only by coming into contact with another text (with context). Only at the point o', ' and the proposition that the person explains the poem.”17 \\n 2RPP Poetry as Mnemonic Atlas 185 It is perhaps a “natural reading strategy” for readers of lyrical poetry to identify the author’s person with his persona. As Roland Barthes remarks, “The [...] it.”18 The authorial function creates a sense of consistency for the various creations through the author’s life, which may well be an illusion. However, even to the most selfconscious critics, biographism is hard to avoid. In effect, we may reverse Roland Barthes’s assertion on its head and say that no “author” is ever dead, since, in his own words, “The author is never more than the instance writing.”19 Arguably, asserting that the poem bears no relation to its historical author is absurdist, an attempt to prioritize the fetishism of the text over empirical research or reading.20 Rather, and as this book maintains, the relation between the historical poet and the lyric subjectivity is indeterminate.

In the case of “Night Onboard,” the author’s identity, or even the dating of the composition, does influence the reading of the sentiment of the lyric “I.” It is the purported lyric truth of the “author” in the instance of writing. Rejecting naive biographism does not mean exiling lyric subjectivity. As Käte Hamburger suggests, a poem’s statement is always experienced as a reality statement. For instance, we read a letter by Rilke “as bei', 's life’s enterprise, Wang’s collaboration is portrayed by his followers as sacrificing not only his life but also his reputation— his ultimate act of martyrdom (see chapter 5). \\n 2RPP Poetry as Mnemonic Atlas 191 A poem read this way ceases to be “a [...]’ meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-G od),” but becomes “a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash.”40 It is a mnemonic atlas, carrying memories in a rich variety of species and taxonomies, each with its own voice, contour, and function. The text thus unfolds itself into an open space of creative cacophony. A Creative Cacophony The coexistence of multiple forms of memories in one poem means the coexistence of voices including, but not limited to, the authorial intent. In the case of “Night Onboard,” the voices of the ancient patriots are not necessarily in tune with each other, or even with the authorial voice. The lyric subjectivity insists on their harmony and invites future readers', 'k, in which the rhetorical figure author=corpus governs the narration down to its finest details. What these writers find unacceptable is that such narratives are saturated with a romantic mythology of the full creative subject. Barthes writes: \"The [...] I....

His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future.\"3 For example, not until we had read Kafka did we come to understand such a tale as Hawthorne\\'s \"Wakefield\" more fully. T. S. Eliot long ago spoke of the coexistence of past and present discourses. For Eliot, all texts have a simultaneous existence and compose a simultaneous order. In fact, all literature, according to Michel Gresset, \"becomes a huge intertext if one...programs the conflict between nature and culture (or any other major theme) into the stock of all of one\\'s former readings.\"4 We can thus achieve a simultaneity of awareness o', 'on a textual level. Julia Kristeva defines intertextuality by suggesting that multiple texts exist and operate in relation to others. Roland Barthes similarly argues that a media text is “a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings [...] [...]” (1977, 48). In other words, in seeing intertextuality as an expansion of story across different texts, as Daniela Caselli (2006, 49) proposes, intertextuality creates a scenario in which the meaning of a story may be built in relation not only to the individual story in question but also in relation to other stories that are invoked in the reading process. The same principle underpins the world building of early Disney. Martin Rubin has argued that the “tendency toward explicit intertextuality reached its most intense and overt form in the 1930s” (1990). Rubin in fact claims that intertextuality helped to create distinctive cartoon stars precisely via “topical references to popular songs, sayings, movies, plays, radio shows, books, magazi', 'xt, as a centerless network of freefloating signifiers, offers an irreducible plurality of meanings to be realized by the productive reader.4 Barthes applies his concept of text to what is traditionally conceived as extralinguistic reality as well: \"[...].\"5 Empire of Signs is the practical realization of this theoretical concept. Seeking recourse to poststructuralist definitions of writing, text, significance, and reading, the author transforms what the innocent tourist would call objective reality particles of Japan into a self-referential network of linguistic signification.6 For example, Barthes establishes a structural homology between the function of the signified within the linguistic sign and an insignificant gift or another object wrapped in an elaborate package often considered more important than the contents.

To understand readership this way has an ', 'nteverdi seems to deny the obvious conclusion: the style would allow the composer to have a single first-person “speaker” but we still have two, three, or five of them. Of course, one should expect any book of madrigals that opens with an archetypal [...] piece (and a theatrical one at that) newly arranged for five voices, the “Lamento d’Arianna,” to throw down some kind of gauntlet in the battle of whose “voice” is speaking at any given time. That lament is for a female character, and its counterpart in the Sixth Book, “Incenerite spoglie, avara tomba” (the sestina), has a male one, but, save perhaps for their openings, one can hardly infer this from the polyphonic musical setting. One might also argue that the past-tense narrative of “Una donna fra l’altre” mitigates the need for any newly verisimilar approach to narrative representation: I shall explore other cases of Monteverdi’s (mis)representation of individual “speakers” that at times, though not always, seems associated with things ', 'nactivated. They deal explicitly with the development of \"literature,\" the \"author\" and the \"book\" in western, \"bourgeois capitalist\" civilization. The notion of the author, and the concept of the autonomous human subject that underlies it, are \"the [...],\" Barthes explains, and \"the image of literature\" in bourgeois culture is, as a consequence, \"tyrannically centered on the author, his person, his life, his tastes, his passions.\"2 What happens, though, when an actual tyrant \"tyrannically centers\" his attention on the author\\'s person, life and passions? I cannot enter here into all the many ways in which the development of Russian \"literature as institution\" diverges from its counterparts in the west.3 The student of stalinist-era writing, though, is uneasily aware of the cultural specificity of Barthes\\', Derrida\\'s and Foucault\\'s dead authors and books. All the world\\'s a text, these theorists proclaim; and within this textual kingdom, as Derrida says, \"the \"\\'literal\\' meaning of writing [is', 'sing is deliberate. Whether the scholar sees the genial Trollope seated comfortably in the text, or the irascible Flaubert skulking angrily behind his, critics continue to \"tyranically center,\" as Barthes puts it, \"the image of literature on ... the [...] ...\" but they have reached their quarry by different routes: content in the first case, style in the second. Of course, Trollope\\' s tone tells a tale as well as Nabokov\\'s does, but Nabokov\\'s arrogance is formal, relational, and his control is not that of a fatherly Czar but that of the secret police. The performative \"I declare,\" \"I sing,\" \"I write,\" does not, in fact, cut the text off at the point of the pen, as Barthes seems to think. Nabokov\\'s passage is a performance . . . and a good one. In this sense, Trollope\\' s touch could only dull the master\\'s quill. The problem is not, I think, whether the author is present in the work in one way or another, or whether the text will ever interest us in her, her circle, her temper and times; but ', 'aman in exile from the sea\" (4), his narrative reads like \"the aimless startled cry of a solitary man confronted by his fate\" (340).

One example will make the situation plain.

Even orthodox psychoanalysis, once considered the bane of traditional scholars, has been outflanked by readings less concerned with arriving at a definitive interpretation than with studying the various factors which produce discourse and make its analysis an ongoing activity. In response to detractors who have wanted to see him as a charlatan intent on subverting the institutions of valid interpretation, Barthes has worked in recent years to clarify a mo', 're, according to the sweeping generalizations of contemporary French criticism, constitutes the very essence of literature. \"Literature,\" writes Roland Barthes, \"is that neuter, that composite, that oblique into which every subject escapes, the trap [...] with the very identity of the subject that writes.\"12 The space of writing (ecriture), as the structuralists define it, is a polysemic field, without center or \"author,\" which can be traversed but not penetrated. It is, says Michel Foucault, \"the opening of a space into which the writing subject never ceases to disappear.\"\\'3 This disappearance is exactly what Gogol sought in his narrative technique and what he shows as Akaky\\'s accomplishment through copying.

The central re\", 'rt Reception History of the Genji, ca. 1000–14323 Many scholars have made the case in favor of examining the reception history of a work. In the classic “The Death of the Author,” Roland Barthes located the text in the domain of the reader, where “a [...].”4 Hans Robert Jauss emphasized that “The historical life of a literary work is unthinkable without the active participation of its audience.”5 Stanley Fish’s writing on the Variorum edition of Milton’s early works in “Interpreting the Variorum” may be the most applicable to Genji, since the Variorum represents a commentary tradition. In dealing with this tradition, Fish introduces \\n J. Christopher Kern 317 the concept of an “interpretive community,” which collectively shapes the experience of readers.6 Although Fish’s ultimate conclusions are, as he says, “self-consuming,” the idea of interpretive communities that exist in a particular society, with a set of assumptions and goals in reading, provides a good way to understand the reception', ' a dancefloor, even the figure of the dance draws one invariably to feet, footprints, repeated patterns, and the narration trace at its most irreducible of Benjaminian pure language. this intertextual rendition recalls Barthes’s argument that “(t)he [...] [. . .] [the author’s] only power is to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others, in such a way as never to rest on any one of them” (146). According to Benjamin, allegory engages the ruins of what historical events once marked. “Fictional autobiography” is oxymoronic in the sense that an autobiography is the truth, a fiction is fabricated, and a fictional autobiography is a destabilizing narration of the past where even the “auto” of autobiography, the “self” designated, becomes undesignable.

(Barthes, Intro. S/Z) This type of strategem for theory of poetry rightly identifies the privilege accorded to textual authority and the place of meaning with Judaeo-Christian world view. It then defines itself in part by rejecting the moral authority associated with this world view. The perspective is not unknown in the field of biblical criticism itself, where indeed it predates its secular counterparts. More than a century ago Kierkegaard employed a poetic strategy to query the ethical implications of a type of criticism which spends most of its energy evading the mo', 'to \"echo the white man\\'s thinking.\" Theory proclaims the death of the author and the end of his mastery. The writer does not control language but enters into it, accepting it and its premises; the writer\\'s \"only power,\" Roland Barthes argues, \"is to [...] on any one of them\" (146). Barthes continues: \"Did he wish to express him self\\'—or, let me add, did he wish to represent a natural reality—\"he ought at least to know that the inner\"—or the outer—\"\\'thing\\' he thinks to \\'translate\\' is itself only a ready-formed dictionary, its words only explainable through other words, and so on indefinitely . . .\" (146). But this might seem like a very theoretical point indeed. After all, did Malcolm X not learn the word \"aardvark\" without accepting the ideology of the Afrikaner? Did he not \"express himself\\' clearly and militantly (freely) for more than a decade in an unparalleled critique of racist America? Be that as it may, in the last months of his life, after his pilgrimage of 1964 to the Holy City of ', 'ity. For Julia Kristeva, every text is \"a permutation of texts, an intertextuality: in the space of a given text, several utterances, taken from other texts, intersect and neutralize one another.\"3 For Roland Barthes, the text is \"a multidimensional [...].\"4 Intertextuality, then, undermines stable notions of authorial presence and of personal influence, and therefore, in some of its manifestations, discovers all language to be speaking in a permanent present. For the purposes of this essay I wish to draw attention to two specific versions of intertextuality. The first is that of Mikhail Bakhtin. Although Bakhtin privileges the novel, a poetics whose key terms include \"dialogism\" and \"carnival\" should have important things to say about drama. As Bakhtin himself asked: \"Isn\\'t every writer (even the purest lyric poet) always a \\'playwright\\' insofar as he distributes all the discourses among alien voices (,..)?\"5 Bakhtin\\'s notion of the \"hidden polemic,\" to which I shall return, offers a fruitf', 'sed manner of reading. Barthes makes this same point, arguing famously that “the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author.”44 He notes that this shift in the power dynamic of author and reader is long overdue, arguing that “[...].”45 While I argue here that one element of a postanarchist literary theory is to make good on Barthes’s command, I do not mean to suggest that this shift is not already an important element of contemporary literary criticism in its various forms. What I do want to stress is the manner in which other contemporary literary theories—among them reader response but also historical materialism and its ilk—have recognized the importance of the reader insofar as s/he receives and makes sense of the text in question. \\n 94 Dani Spinosa Postanarchism hears Foucault’s assertion, and understands Barthes’ call to arms, as a merger of author and reader in the form of an author-function that is in constant engagement with a real or imagined audience, whic', 'e wider context of Indian and Indic manuscript culture, there are other instances known of such manuscripts.

When I asked this question to the Indology list (http://listinfo.indology.info), several colleagues kindly shared their insights with me (search the thread ‘Manuscript copies of printed books’). I can summarize the reasons put forward―which are not mutually exclusive―as follows. A manuscript copy remained for a long time the only way of having a copy of a book, be it handwritten or printed. ‘In those days there was no coffee’ wrote Va. Ramaswamy Iyengar in 1943, reflecting on the 19th-century context (Venkatachalapathy 2006, 12). There were no Xerox-machines either. In case a physical copy of a printed book was needed, there were not', ', \"a multi-dimen sional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend 202 \\n Franklin\\'s Autobiography 203 and clash\" (146). From this perspective, the writer can never be unique, for he has substituted language for individuality: [...]. (142) Since there can be no interiority but language, the writer\\'s work?even his autobiography?must be potential, \"ready-formed,\" anonymous. But the process by which the text reaches that stage is itself one of increasing anonymity, an emptying out of the autobiographer\\'s life as he struggles to adapt private reminiscences to the demands of discourse. The compos ing process involves constant loss?the vividness of the life-lived yielding to ever greater accommodations and distortions as the autobiographer shapes his work. The completed text, then, is as much a product of its audience as of its author.1 By inserting the letters where he does, preceding his condensation of the \"Art of Virtue,\" Franklin announces his chief intention for his t', 'ate it...,\" and so writing, \"by refusing to assign to the text (and to the world-as-text) a \\'secret,\\' i.e. an ultimate meaning, liberates an activity we may call countertheological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to halt meaning is finally to [...]\" (54). 5 See Fredric Jameson\\'s The Prison-House of Language (1972) and Geoffrey Gait Harpham\\'s Language Alone (2002) for thorough accounts of the linguistic turn in re lation to literary theory. Jameson and Harpham are criti cal of the philosophical and political consequences of the widespread and often uncritical adoption of Saussurean linguistics in literary theory. For Jameson, abandoning the signified and referent in favor of the signifier implies a withdrawal from political thinking, and he concludes that the notion that \"everything is language is as indefen sible as it is unanswerable\" (185). Harpham regards this emphasis on language as \"the critical fetish of modernity\" (57), and he argues that since language can only be de scribed ', ', ever changing as each interpreter reads them according to his or her ideological context. In his essay \"The Death of the Author\" (1977), Barthes referred to literary criticism, yet his ideas held considerable import to art history. Barthes stated: [...] ... we know that to give writing its future, it is necessary to overthrow the myth: the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author, (p. 148) Modernist art history, as classic criticism, paid scant heed to the viewer (reader). The intent of the artist (author) was the focus of interpretation. Utilizing theories in addition to semiotics, scholars engaged in postu lating the new art histories shifted meaning making from the object and artist to the interpreter. Through these intertextual cross-fertilizations, art history theory and practice was being rewritten. Despite the introduction of reception theory into art history, however, no theorizing of how a lay public might construct meaningful interpretations of artworks', '. Nothing, supposedly, can be changed about a text once the author (along with the publisher and editor) have finished with it.

Most hypertext theorists would agree. Snyder also points out that oral texts had many of the features that theorists claim are inherent in hypertexts. Oral texts could be revised at will by the speaker, who altered stories depending on the prompts from an audience. But book technology provided a new framing device for narrative and other forms. Murray points out that with electronic text the \"author\" is procedural, like a choreographer, \"who supplies the rhythms, the context, and the set of steps that will be performed\" (153).

Her use of the [...] “I sell” also declares her ownership of her image: to sell it, she must own it. But what is it that she sells? A shadow, she tells us, a shadow that can be sold. Sojourner Truth’s terminology is hardly original. As scholars have long pointed out, photographs were sometimes called shadows, and advertisements cajoled readers “to fix the shadow ’ere the substance fades.”8 In an 1861 letter, a correspondent explained that he could not send a photograph because there were no “itinerant shadow catchers” in the area.9 Most simply then, the shadow is the small, modest, cheap, mass-produced, and exceedingly popular photographic carte-de-visite that Sojourner Truth sold to support herself, often at lectures, sometimes by correspondence.10 In the mos', ' at once as a necessary part of processes of enquiry begun (according to standard definitions of grand theory) under the imprimatur of poststructuralism. Back in the distant 1970s and moving into his poststructuralist mode, Roland Barthes wrote: \\'We [...]\" meaning (the \"message\" of the Author-God) but a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture.\\'6 Ghosting behind Barthes\\' pronouncement, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein and Saussure would applaud this disestablishment of ideas of originality and singularity together with the invitation it provides for reading, rereading and interpretive variety. The freedom is exhilarating. But, at the same time, poststructuralist theory (and its reformulations) emphasizes connections. Derrida\\'s investigations of guilt and responsibility can be located not instead of or beyond but alongside his elaborations of the \\'freeplay\\' of textual', \"d', the subject who claims the single origin of and final signified for his words.

Hans Haacke, 'Information 2', Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects, The New York Cultural Center, New York, 1970, p. 32. 29. The reverse should be noted as well. Structuralism leans heavily on a notion of the informational. Take, for example, Jameson's description of the structuralist principle of binary opposition: 'We would ourselves be tempted to describe [the binary opposition] as a technique for stimulating perception, when faced with a mass of apparently homogenous data to which the mind and the eyes are numb . . . It is a decoding or deciphering device, or alternately, a technique of language learning.

The presence of unspeakable pain, however, shatters the illusion of, for example, a shared, private language between lovers. This shattering of the illusion of a coherent body, self, and narration has implications for authorship that align with the potentially (but not always) resistant nature of collaborative writing. Epistemic authority is called into question in both writing the body\\'s pain and in unsettling the \"deification\" of the singular, authoritative, all-knowing speaker who writes without bothering to imagine who \"is listening to [her] talk.\"17 If the limits of language prevent us from writing the body\\'s pain (or the 193 \\n nature of pain prevents i', 'st\" order against them, closing the production in January of 1985. In constructing their performance texts, the Group seems to assume a poststructuralist idea of textuality like that advanced by Roland Barthes, for whom a text is \"a multidimensional [...] of 34\"For a Concept of the Political,\";\\' 155. LeCompte\\'s own account of the Group\\'s political stance is that they are looking for \"another way of making theatre, another way of viewing politics that is not literal, issue-oriented - it\\'s not attached, so to speak\" (quoted by Aronson, 74). 35David Savran, \"The Wooster Group, Arthur Miller and The Crucible,\" TDR T106 (1985), esp. 99-103. \\n 34 / TI, March 1987 culture.\\'36 This formulation creates obvious problems for the legal concept of text as property upon which Miller based his claim. If the text is made up of quotations to begin with, if it arises in some sense from the culture itself and not from the idiosyncratic mind of the writer (who must therefore be described as \"scriptor\" rather t', 'r personality. Barthes asks, of a piece of dialogue spoken by a character in Balzac, “Who is speaking in this way? Is it the story’s hero . . . ? Is it the man Balzac . . . ? Is it the author Balzac, professing certain ‘literary’ ideas . . . ? Is it [...]?” He concludes, “It will always be impossible to know, for the good reason that all writing is itself this special voice, consisting of several indiscernible voices, and that literature is precisely the invention of this voice, to which we cannot assign a specific origin . . .” (142). In saving us from the historicist project of “deciphering” a text, to “finish” the text by (re)solving it critically, Barthes opens it up to what Pater saw as the prerogative of the reader all along. Barthes is pronouncing the “birth of the reader” through the ransoming of the “death of the Author,” but we misunderstand if we think what a reader finds in the text isn’t substantiated by the figment of personality. There is a person there; even one that differe', 'Author also is instructive. Barthes argued that the \"who\" of the author can never be answered. The origin and unity of the text always slip away; it cannot be unified under the sign of the Author. Nevertheless, Barthes writes, in modern society: The [...]\" in us. (p. 143) Foucault (1984) adds that the idea of the author \"constitutes the privileged moment of individualization in the history of ideas, knowl edge, literature, philosophy and the sciences\" (p. 101). As suggested above, we can associate this individualization and specification of the origin with the demand for punishment and with economic exchange. More than this, like the Man of Reason and Practitioner, the Author serves as a kind of stopping point that arrests the openness and play of the text. \"To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing\" (Barthes, 1977, p. 147). \"The author allows a limitation of the cancerous and dangerous proliferation of significati', 'ion and specification of the origin with the demand for punishment and with economic exchange.

To bring several threads together: as Farmer notes, the death of the author has nothing whatever to do with physical execution. Rather, in this embrace of its death, one ceases to see The Practitioner as the hero of the \"PA story.\" He is radically decentered and no longer viewed as the originator and narrator of PA or the authoritative, privileged posi tion from which to speak in public administration. This embrace, this transcending, ', 'the world of writing. A performance-less author produces author-less writing, a body of signs whose creator becomes removed from presence and presentation. As Roland Barthes writes in his iconic essay \"The Death of the Author,\" literature \"is only a [...]\" within which \"the space of writing is to be ranged over, not pierced; writing ceaselessly posits meaning ceaselessly to evaporate it, carrying out a systemic exemption of meaning\" (147). Barthes s funeral knell for the author resonates with Anonymous s celebration of its birth, lending an unintentional appropriateness of the films title: rather than an oblivion of nonrecognition into which Oxford is cast, anonymity becomes, in the anti-Stratfordian fantasy, the predetermined outcome of pure authorship.12 The professed disgust with Shakespeare s name emblazoning the Folio masks a deeper disgust over the smudge of human performance that must accompany any act of writing.

Toklas’s, or “Everybody” else’s identities—the meaning of writing does not occur, as formerly thought, within the mind of the author but, instead, within the mind of the reader: “[T]he reader is the very space in which [...], all the citations out of which a writing is made; the unity of a text is not in its origin but in its destination” (54). Thus, in modern and postmodern theories of authorship, the author/autobiographer has little to no “control” over the meaning of her work. The text itself is always unstable and cannot be fixed to a single meaning that would reflect an author’s “true” intent, no matter how much an author or autobiographer would wish it to be so. Obviously, authors and theorists such as Barthes and Stein experiment with and challenge the boundaries and the “author-ity” of written texts.

Barthes, \"The Death of the Author\" LOUD NINE, Caryl Churchill\\'s first major commercial success, had its beginnings in a theater workshop on sexual politics that was arranged in collaboration with the director Max Stafford-Clark and the now defunct Joint Stock Theatre Group. By all accounts, the workshop was a profoundly enlightening experience. It promoted intense exploration of the relation of sexuality and gender to power and authority and provided the material from which Churchill developed her play. The workshop was deliberately inclusive: the selection of participants was based not only on acting ability but also on diversity of sexual identities. Careful orchestration created an open environment where participants recounted their se', 'the duty of providing immortality, now possesses the right to kill, to be its author\\'s murderer (...)\" (142). With this clear reference to Roland Barthes, Foucault links Beckett\\'s work to \"The Death of the Author\".

The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture. (146) At first sight, this seems to be exactly what happens with the adjective \"faint\" in Beckett\\'s manuscript of Stirrings Still. But there is a difference with the self-confident and victorious tone in Barthes\\' and Foucault\\'s voices. What Foucault interprets as \"indifference\" toward the 4 \"Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'un auteur?\" Lecture at the Soci6t6 frangaise de Philosophie, February 1969; published in the Bulletin de la Societdfrancaise de philosophie, Vol. 63, No. 3, 1969. 5 \"Qu\\'importe qui parle, quelqu\\'un a dit qu\\'importe qui parle.\" \\n Undoing Dante - 91 notion of a', 'y), considered later developments, are all part and parcel of the poet\\'s response, that is, the \"statement\" itself. 14 To put it another way, the rhetorical itself is often the \"statement\" a poem makes.

Or, in Edward Said\\'s words: \"To what extent is a text so discontinuous a series of subtexts or pre-texts or paratexts or surtexts as to beggar the question of an author as simple producer?\" (Said 1975:58). 14 McCullough\\'s discussion of KKS 113 mentioned in the next paragraph, where she notes the potential for multiple interpretation, actually demonstrates the impossibility of keeping the elements distinct, but her concern with \"originality\" obscures the total linguistic picture. \\n 38 RICHARD H.

The interaction that necessarily must occur between reader and writer, then, depends greatly upon the attitudes behind the words as well as upon the words themselves. Contrary to Barthes\\' argument that \"[...] origin . . . beginning with the very identity of the body that writes\" (49), the birth of the female reader must be requited by the rebirth, not the death, of the author. Only through the socio-linguistic rebirth of the resisting writermale or femalecan language function as a true indicator of social and cultural values, and specifically of changing perceptions of gender. A neutral discourse, designed to be inoffensive but undergirded by resistance to the very language it employs, becomes the basis for continuing humorous treatment of the inequalities inherent in language.

In \"The Death of the Author,\" Barthes argues that narrative begins when \"the author enters into his own death\" (142). But after the author enters this death, where does he go?1 His destination, according to Barthes, is the reader: \"The [...]\" (148). The enactment of reading constitutes the reader\\'s \"identity,\" but such an identity is theatrical, contingent, relational, spatial. The reader inhabits a place of activity rather than possessing a subjectivity: \"the reader is without history, biography, psychology\" (148). The reader, in becoming writing\\'s destination, inhab its an identity-less-ness that is crucial to becoming something other than who or what we are; it is fundamental to the transformation of subjectivity that we seek in reading. To read is to long to return to ourselves from a different angle than the one we possessed at our departure point. To read is to love; it is to refuse to let any word be lost. But such a refusal of loss is itself annihilating. To be that re', 'approach to texts. On the other hand, there are two essays in the volume which detail the changes in approach to texts over the last decade, essays appropriately entitled \"The Death of the Author\" and \"From Work to Text.\" Barthes informs us that \"We [...]- 235', 'ary theories that assign the author little or no importance, Miles has forgotten. Miles Green\\'s total lack of memory of anything before this \"birth\" connects to a passage in Roland Barthes\\' \"The Death of the Author\" in which Barthes claims that \"the [...],\" and the author \"is not the subject with the book as predicate.\"\\'4 The birth scene 65 \\n TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE works better if the reader is still ignorant of the skull location; Fowles creates an enigma that the reader solves with dawning recognition of the allegorical location. A similar delayed reaction also characterizes the dialectic structure of Fowles\\'s argument with theory; Mantissa\\'s characters first state a position about the source of literary creativity equivalent to the contemporary critic\\'s; this statement is then refuted by an aspect of the novel\\'s structure or by a second statement that carries the logic to the next step, reveals its absurdity, and so discredits it. For example, \"At a certain level,\" says Miles Green', 'ly vain. Most of them are still under the positively medieval illusion that they write their own books\" (M, p. 119). Miles\\'s openly unfair tone fits with Barthes\\' ridicule of the author who thinks he must \"delay and indefinitely \\'polish\\' his form\": \"[...] \"the pathetic view of their predecessors,\" that the hand that writes \"is too slow for his thought or passion\" (DA, p. 146). And later in \"The Death of the Author,\" Barthes insists that what occurs is \"a pure gesture of inscription (and not of expression),\" which \"traces a field without origin,\" or which at least, \"has no other origin than language itself, language which ceaselessly calls into question all origins\" (DA, p. 146). And incidentally, for Barthes, the same is true of the reader, and hence of the critic: \"This \\'I\\' which approaches the text is already itself a plurality of other texts, of codes which are infinite or, more precisely, lost (whose origin is lost).\"25 In parallel, Fowles\\'s Erato raises the issue of the origin of Miles', 'ntal leap from a text at hand to another text which they recollect (Kristeva, 1984). The individual and often idiosyncratic nature of making intertextual links augments potential for conflict in teacher-class interactions around texts. In describing [...],\" Barthes (1988, p. 170) asserts that it is the reader\\'s role to achieve unity of meaning. By implication, this view places quite an awesome albeit appropriate responsibility on the shoulders of beginning readers. Readers must find their own path through a text. Reading may be characterized as a shuttling process, as Scholes (1975) has put it, \"back and forth between the language of the work and a network of contexts which are not in the work but are essential for its realization\" (p. 147). Intertextual Conflicts during Teacher- Class Interaction 13 \\n As a process, intertextuality is not always conscious or explicit (Kristeva, 1984). In young children a shift from one text to another is often signaled by utterances that only partially expr', ' of superseded concepts? Yes: criticism, regrouping in the wake of some hundred years of psychological exploration and revision, calling into question first the validity of the writer\\'s intentions and, more recently, his existence as other than \"the [...]\";6 criticism has, willy-nilly, made us skeptical of what it means to speak of an \"authorial voice.\" But also no: to acknowledge the complication of that voice and the dispersal of its singular authority does not, need not, require the additional belief that the writer is simply sucked into the vortex of language, losing himself irretrievably in the funhouse. How, then, is one to negotiate the extremes of the old-fashioned integrated and the newly fashionable absent self? In fact, the problem for the contemporary critic who, conceding the primacy of language (langue), believes nevertheless that what matters is the irreducible witness of individual expression (parole) - the problem, that is, for all practical critics - is to discover a way o', \"gave a momentum to the quest for new equality between the author/narrator and the readers, and among the readers.

Exotic Tense: The Ethnographic Present Tense One caution must be issued before we unconditionally praise the p\", 't into \"a liberation-theology\" (186). A topic such as the death of the subject is best approached relationally, as Durham has seen; in this discursive universe, subject, author, God, and reader circle each other in antagonistic interdependence. \"The [...],\" wrote Barthes, who initiated this topic with an ebullience that has not always been retained. In what follows, I want to modify Durham\\'s account of Valis by looking at the peculiar relation set up between reader and author. \\n 338 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 18 (1991) Dick is characteristically a writer who challenges the reader\\'s capacity for belief as well as arousing his or her sympathies. Put under pressure, the reader of The Simulacra (for instance) might ask, \"How can I believe that people in the novel could believe that they were ruled for 70 years by the same unaging young woman, hosting unexciting TV shows?\"-and then proceed to ask, \"How could P.K. Dick believe this? Did he give credence to it as part of his fiction, or did h', 'sical Merrythought, he does not exist outside, or independent of, the text; he is himself a construction of those discourses, the author as staged persona, \"a tissue of quotations.\" Furthermore, like the \"text\" Barthes theorizes, a \"multidimensional [...]\" (146), Rafe is without origin-as the Wife puts it in her epilogue, \"a poore fatherlesse child\" (K4, Epi.4). And to this extent he reproduces the troubled patrilineage of the text that begets him. According to Foucault, \"the author is the principle of thrift in the proliferation of meaning . . . a certain functional principle by which, in our culture, . . . one impedes the free circulation, the free manipulation, the free composition, decomposition, and recomposition of fiction\" (118-19). And though, as we have seen, a dispersal of the author in The Knight of the Burning Pestle does allow fiction to circulate more freely, we would be mistaken to think that the fatherless status of both the Knight (Rafe) and The Knight figures the freeing o', 'oice. The “prestige of the individual” was such that, in each case, it authorized the future text and authored the past. The readerly commentary was the death of textual potentialities. The diametrically opposite position is articulated by Barthes: “[...] . . . but there is one place where this multiplicity is focused and that place is the reader, not, as was hitherto said, the author.” See Barthes, “Death,” 142, 148. 32. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, “Ifāḍa,” 11. 33. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, “Ifāḍa,” 10–11. 34.

Recent scholarship has demonstrated that notions of the genuine and originary emerged as essential conditions of the modern regime of authorship owing to the heroic', 'reative presence. Andrade is approaching-- although from a different point of view--the problem discussed by Barthes in \"The Death of the Author.\" Where Andrade suggests that the work (the readerly?) dies, Barthes speaks of the demise of the author: [...]. . . . As soon as a fact is narrated no longer with a view to acting directly on reality but intransitively, that is to say, finally outside of any function other than that of the very practice of the symbol itself, this disconnection occurs, the voice loses its origin, the author enters into his own death, writing begins.3 With A Morta Andrade considers the importance and perhaps the impossibility of keeping the author alive (that is to say, present in his text as a constant, active participant), of keeping the work alive and living. He strives to produce a writerly text. The first act of A Morta is his best attempt. It is the least accessible of the three acts and the one that best fits Mario da Silva Brito\\'s overall characterization of ', 'view--the problem discussed by Barthes in \"The Death of the Author.\" Where Andrade suggests that the work (the readerly?) dies, Barthes speaks of the demise of the author: Writing is the destruction of every voice, of every point of origin. . . .

It is the least accessible of the three acts and the one that best fits Mario da Silva Brito\\'s overall characterization of the play as a \"farsa solene e hermetica, de linguagem tantas vezes abstrata e buscada.\"4 He may have a point. Early in the act the dialogue is interrupted by a knock at the door: O POETA - O que havera atras de uma porta? A OUTRA - Abre a porta! Chi Zo sd ! O POETA - Pode ser a girafa, o oficial de justisa, a metralhadora,', 't is, to resume the New Critic\\'s habit of tagging heresies, the \"Edenic fallacy\" of criticism, the faith that names-or literary formssomehow connect simply with experience, and that experience and formalization may be discussed interchangeably. Some [...] the pervasiveness and subtlety of the \"Edenic fallacy\" clear. Wayne Booth\\'s The Rhetoric of Fiction is a long and careful refutation of James-and-Lubbock style premises about the putative \"realism\" of narrative distance, \"scenic\" storytelling technique, and evaluatively neutral language. Booth is at pains to demonstrate that, in fact, all narrators judge, blacken, or embellish their characters, and that fiction is necessarily-though often implicitly-a morally normative act. As an assertion of the essential fictiveness of the fictive art, his arguments are a useful corrective to earlier orthodoxies, much in the manner of Dr. Johnson\\'s final \"solution\" of the problem of the dramatic unities and verisimilitude by the observation that the spec', 'ics\"\\' contribution to it. 9. Later, Roland Barthes\\' (1977) post-structuralist doctrine of \"the death of the author\" continued to undermine the idea that a work of art must mean what its author intended it to mean. Barthes writes, \"To write is ... to [...], \\'performs,\\' and not \\'me\"\\' (p. 143). 10. See Wimsatt and Beardsley, \"The Affective Fallacy\\' (1949) and \"The Intentional Fallacy\" (1954). 11. The term \"objective\" is sometimes used to refer to a complete or total \"God\\'s eye view\" of reality. On other occasions the term signifies an un-emotional or detached stance one might adopt towards the object of inquiry. Still another use of the term is to refer to reasonable and rational arguments made in support of one or another point of view. It is this last meaning I have in mind in suggesting that artistic meaning, as well as one\\'s interpretive claims of its nature, are objective. 12. I use the term \"phenomenological\" to refer to the principles of inquiry developed by Edmund Husserl in his Ideas:', ' the text.1 Loosely defined, the poststructural movement \"doubts the adequacy of structuralism and, as far as literature is concerned, tends to reveal that the meaning of any text is, of its nature, unstable\" (Cuddon 691). According to Barthes, \"The [...]\" (145). He argues that the Author as the \"person\" defined is extra-textual and does not bear any influence on the text itself. The removal of the Author renders any attempt to decipher authorial intentionality as futile, for the text performs independently and readers are free to subjectively interpret the enunciation of its voice. In what follows, I situate Clemens as an author within the context of Barthes s theory and the current poststructural conversation regarding the authorial figure and its function to claim that Clemens engages in a writing process that anticipates the theoretical death of the Author. He does not try to circumvent this impending and inevitable event; rather, he accepts it and takes an active part in it by committi', 'lization of the process that Roland Barthes initiated. Clemens acknowledges and accepts the role of what Barthes terms the \"scriptor.\" The scriptor stands in contrast to the Author and exists to produce the text, but not to explain it. This role \"is [...] here and now \\' (Barthes 145). By accepting his role as extratextual and limited to the scene of writing, Clemens s presence as an Author is effectively removed from the text. He was aware of this absence and actively warned critics and readers against searching for design or purpose in his writing and trying to impose intentionality on his works. This view is somewhat sarcastically, but still theoretically, expressed in the famous \"Notice\" to th z Adventures of Huckleberry Finn : \"Persons attempting to find a Motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a Moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a Plot in it will be shot,\" signed \"By Order of the Author\" (xxxi). Clemens collaborates with the text ', 'Journal 47 the right way to build an autobiography\" (Leary 611). The different textual voices are not only the materials he uses for the manuscripts construction, but also further evidence denoting its poststructural nature. As Barthes explains, \"We [...]) but a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash\" (146). The multiple and various voices in the text exist independently and extinguish that of the Author-God. They are free to converge in the subjective minds of readers in unique ways that allow them to create meaning from the language. As narrator of the Autobiography, Twain summarizes the results and benefits of this method: \"my autobiography is diary and history combined. The privilege of beginning every day in the diary form is a valuable one\" {AMT 1 : 283). Moreover, as Kiskis describes, the production of the Autobiography was a collaborative process, and Clemens took into account the advice of his friends, family, and co-workers. T', 'njoined. This conjunction takes place not because the original text or author lives on or through us, as Bloom believes, but because the author is dead. In an essay 165 \\n NEW LITERARY HISTORY entitled \"The Death of the Author\" Barthes explains: \"The [...] ... in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his child.

To assign a text an author is \"to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing,\" whereas for Barthes, \"to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases-reason, science, law\" (IMT 147).

The reader no longer consumes a ready-made, finished product but rather performs an act of \"practical collaboration\" (as opposed to \"practical criticism\") and writes the text he reads. The act of writing itself, the \"question of critical style,\" is one of the main polemical concerns of Geoffrey Hartman\\'s Criticism in the Wilderness. In his', 'ysical pursuit of the trail of incomplete and tenuously related texts, a concrete play of signifiers. Another of Barthes\\'s directives about how to read writing serves as both a plot description of Traveler and as a method of reading the work: In the [...] (\"Death of the Author\" 147). This notion of reading can be applied to Traveler in several ways—first, as a description of Reader\\'s terrestrial Odyssey, and second, of our, the readers\\', textual Odyssey. On one level we follow the plot of Reader\\'s quest for a completed work; on another, we contend with a complete work, the \"macrotext\" of Travelers (as Carl Malmgren refers to it) which we hold in our hands. For Reader, each text in his pilgrimage, each unit in the multiplicity of writing \"evaporates\" only to posit yet another unit of writing, the beginning of another novel.

The suggestion, made explicit in Henley\\'s note, is that different sorts of question require not only different answers, but different languages in which to frame answers: that there are languages devoted to \"the prophetick, the mystical, the philosophic^ and so on. On this model, Vathek would be seen as operating within the wrong language.

In effect, then, the rise of the self as individual and as subject, which was a historical process with specifiable social and economic determinants, led to the still dominant image of literature as centred on the author, with his own distinctive voice and message, owning his work in the sense of confessing to it as well as of having it as his property and possession. The ideais, according to Barthes, that, 356 \\n with the retrieval of an understanding of the essential dependence of the individual on the social whole, the author is once more becoming the one in whom the surrounding myth of the tribe is articulated: a node within a network, a hiccup, an involuntary spasm, in the endless, open-ended production of signs which is human conver', 'ying, representing) some already formulated \"thought\", or some \"reality out there\", putatively existing prior to, and independently of, the actual writing.

Now, however, when (to adapt Barthes again) the Book that supposedly. just \"revealed\" the already fully formed message of the Author has yielded to a new sense of a text as a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable shifting centres of our multiple tradition, the Reader (as of yore the listener to the teller of the lore) becomes the focus - the necessary active collaborator - in the performance. The book thus becomes a notation, a score, and every reading is a production that constitutes the text. The unity of the text is no longer thought to lie in its origin in the demiurgic author\\'s mind but rather in the interplay between writer and reader - and the writer of such a text, as opposed to the author of a book, will have left many', 's in the uncanny moment of the moment of complexity, the emergent, kairotic moment, that we abide.14 Purdue University West Lafayette, Indiana Notes 1.

Moby-Dick exemplifies Barthes' definition of a text: We [...]. w Formally exact, since Melville's citations and allusions are everywhere evident, this definition applies to his thematics as well - to his insistent attention to the whale's ubiquitousness and mystery, human obsessions with explanatory systems and control, ritual and the symbolic, and, therefore, to the very processes of mythopoesis itself.11 His reflexive metafictional markers point to the intersection of 'process' and 'product.' Indicating a perspective on the nature of meaning as that which must be tracked through thickets of possibilities, they convey a lively sense of unending investigation in which the (false) comfort of ending gives way to the joy (and the joyful frustrations) of journeying itself, to the incessant movement of a \", \"he era of genetic criticism to a close. 4 See, for example, Claude Jacquet, Genèse et métamorphoses du texte joycien. 5 The concept of the authorial hypostasis is evoked in a difficult, thoughtprovoking, parenthesis in Barthes's landmark essay: 'The [...])', 'The Death of the Author', Image, Music, Text , p. 147. 6 Flaubert 'a besoin, enfin, de documentalistes '.

Barthes recognizes Mallarme as the \"[...] speaks; \"the /which writes the text, it too, is never more than a paper-I\" (IMT 161). The pronominal characters of much Postmodern fiction are related both to Barthes\\'s \"paper-I\" and to the concept of the text as (solely) self-referential. Barthes\\'s attention to the problematics of lan guage, and particularly to liberating the signifier, is closely related to Postmodern thought. (See Personage, Patterns of Structure, Play, Production.) Prose In Writing Degree Zero (1953), Barthes asked, \"Is there any Poetic Writing?\" Much later he explains what may have been the reason for his choice to devote both his critical and his creative energies to prose. The lyric, when summarized, loses its identity (\"summarized, lyric poems come down to the sign', \"of the author that lends the text its authority, nor does it involve the theory of egotistical sublimity wrongly associated with romanticism, in which that authority derives from the massive presence of the author.

There is for him a dialectical tension be\\xad tween author and text, in which the text assumes a degree of autonomy, but in which the writer, too, must take a stand (or a series of stands) outside these differences that never seem to progress toward identities. Such, for instance, is the tension in Blake's Songs between a series of poems that endlessly displace and rewrite each other, and the voice of the bard, which in some sense clearly does represent 'Blake' himself, but without making Blake present to us. This demand that the authors declare themselves is explored more fully in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Against the attempts in phil\\xad osophical and religious hermeneutics to establish t\", \"lism maintains that 'writing is the destruction of . . . every point of origin . . . starting with the very identity of the body writing'.9 There is no fixed 'original', since linguistic form cannot embody definitive meaning. As Barthes explains: 'a [...] . . . but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash'.10 The MLA statement acknowledges the many benefits of copying, particularly in the interests of conservation, since it may facilitate the preservation of brittle or acidic papers that would be damaged by continual handling. The statement further recognises the contribution of copying to circulation, welcoming the 'technical advances that permit the dissemination and manipulation of texts',11 and bring about greater access and flexibility in the fréquentation of texts and their uses. But access and preservation, as has been acknowledged in debates around 'heritage', can be mutually cancelling objectives. \\n 334 Critical Survey, volume\", 'etation eines Textes beides, ,,Contextbound meaning \\' \\' und , , boundless context \\' \\' .

Reading, and not the inscribing by an author of his previous thought, is the genuine locus of writing. As Barthes (1972, p. 15) says: The reader is the very space in which [...], all the citations a writing consists of; the unity of a text is not in its origin, it is in its destination; but this destina? tion can no longer be personal: the reader is a man without history, without biography, without psychology; he is only that someone who holds gathered into a single field all the paths of which the text is constituted. The upshot of these claims is that the text is not under the governance of some logos, reason, or thing which is independent of it. Nor can the text, the document, be taken as an ultimate standard to which interpretations must conform. The usual notion of truth as correspondence, Derrida (1972, pp. 7Iff.) says, must be if not demolished, at least deconstructed, for it is a residue of metaphysico-the', 'I differentiate \"writer\" here from Roland Barthes\\'s scripteur, as defined in \"The Death of the Author.\" Barthes, in differentiating this term from the \"Author-God\" that unifies a text and forecloses the movement of its interpretation, says its \"only [...] on any one of them\" in a purely performative mode, created simultaneously with the text (146). The flesh-and-blood Wallace signals to the reader an awareness of the multiple selves cre ated by the act of writing, suggesting some creative influence beyond recombination of previously existing material. Yet I argue in this essay that David Wallace is, as Barthes says, not properly an author. Any meaning created in The Pale King ultimately does not reflect back upon David Wallace because of the opacity created through the divisions between selves. 11. Coetzee\\'s fiction, too, offers ample resources to discuss the challenges of self and repre sentation in autobiography. Carrol Clarkson notes that, for Coetzee, \"\\'He\\' is relentlessly called up in ', 'gnifiance and textuality into history and to weave theory and formal criti? cism into ethnography (Hutcheon 94-101). In 1968, Roland Barthes\\'s words about the multidimensional space seemed like a revelation: We know now that a text consists not of a [...]\" meaning (the \"message\" of the Author- God), but of a multi-dimensional space in which are married and contested several writings, none of which is original: the text is a fabric of quotations, resulting from a thousand sources of culture. (Barthes 52-53) Today, long after he led critics \"from work to text,\" these words are a textbook cliche (Childers and Hentzi 159). But Barthes was pointing to contestations that linguists, ethnographers, and folklorists were already demonstrating. Pidgin and creole languages like Mauritian kreol or Comoran kingazidja are new mixtures. Folktales about the defiant girl or Ti Zan and Gran Dyab are both a fabric of quotations and equally new.

The image of literature to be found in ordinary culture is tyrannically centred on the author, his person, his life, his tastes, his passions”, as if authors are continually confiding in us (50). In the literary milieu of Paris, where Barthes lived, attention to language had replaced attention to the users of language. The old centreing on the author, said Barthes, had to end. He announced the death of the author. Writing, he said, destroys the very concept of author, or voice. Looking outside Europe, Barthes understood that in non- Western societies “the responsibility for a narrative is never assumed by a person but by a mediator, shaman or reciter ...” (49). He was right about Malagasy performers. They conventionally recite opening', '\\n years after my book. Perhaps Ma had seen the name and info on a book jacket, perhaps not. At any rate, at that moment I \"felt,\" as never before, the \"death of the author\" (and perhaps the birth of the scriptor, who as Roland Barthes writes, comes \"[...] the text,\" though the birth was not necessarily \"mine\"). If it is true that you don\\'t exist unless you\\'re on the Internet, it is also true that if you\\'re on the Internet, you don\\'t exist: the Internet is the ether in which subjectivity exists as trace. The name is emptied out of life and becomes the marker for a bundle of data, harvested and sold by the corporate collectors of consumer spending records and preferences. And \"you\" can\\'t even properly \"die,\" as demonstrated in a 2011 suit against Facebook filed by an Austrian law student, after he discovered the corporation had been keeping information he\\'d removed from his Facebook page.

No melody to remember, no beat to teach to. Of course, texts-on-texts continue to be produced, the profession continues to maintain its status as MILTON QUARTERLY 45 a profession, and producers of texts continue to market their wares and themselves; but in this new world of words there would seem to be very little literature for the teacher of literature to teach in a literary way—\"that\\'s what that modern malice done for you.\" I am not of course ', 'take, then, in equating the language of Finnegans Wake with hoarded waste, or, put another way, what is the relationship between litter and literature for Joyce? As an emblematic inkbottle, Shem\\'s house is the site of an \"inkbattle\"; it serves as a \"[...] of them origi nal, blend and clash,\" exemplifying Barthes\\'s notion of textuality.32 Because modern language is accumulative, an assemblage of the decayed languages that have preceded it, it shares a philosophical affinity with trash. A. R. Ammons makes this point in his 1993 long poem, Garbage, when he characterizes language as \"a waste of words, a flattened-down, smoothed-/over mesa of Styrofoam verbiage.\"33 Comparing the mind to a garbage dump, Ammons writes, \"[T]here is a mound,/too, in the poet\\'s mind dead language is hauled/off to and burned down on,\" and by its nature, poetry is \"a plentiful waste and/waste of plenty\" (20, 103). Joyce proposes this same conflation of language with material waste in the catalogue of Shem\\'s ink bottle,', 'mage and critique, quotation and self-parody. Central to the film is a myth of authorship, for Fassbinder\\'s appearance in Lili Marleen has all of the trappings of a privileged moment. That myth has perhaps been best described by Roland Barthes: \"The [...].\" I\\'ve suggested that the desire, in feminist criticism, to impose the polarities of critique and celebration, is informed by a myth of authorship. The myth of an author \\'confiding\\' in us has particularly forceful impli- \\n 39 cations for feminism, as the reiteration of the very dualism in question in the first place. More specifically, the status of feminist criticism is particularly susceptible to a kind of dutiful or rebellious daughter syndrome. Barthes writes: \"The Author is thought to nourish the book, which is to say that he exists before it, thinks, suffers, lives for it, is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his child.\"13 What is suggested in Lili Marleen , then, is not so much a critique or a celebratio', 'ty in the wake of the narrative.

And he seems satisfied. [...] to the story one more time. The whole story derives from the desire to see, to see how \"my Grandmother Chiang\" on one spring day more than fifty years ago stood in the rice paddy and listened to the baby stirring in her body. We have a cinema-like visual representation here. We first see her standing at the center of our vision, then our view is elevated and we see the background: on the yellow hill there is a black-bricked building. Its presence is constantly felt by Grandmother Chiang because, as we are told, a rich fermer Ch\\'en Wenchih is watching her with a Japanese telescope. Thus a whole visual field is introduced, and a power relationship is brought into the picture. So is history injected into that almost idyllic picture of a pregn', '\\'already read\\'. Every text has its meaning in relation to other texts\" (Allen 6). Graham Allen is here referring to Barthes\\'s poststructuralist definition of a text in \"The Death of the Author\" (1968). As Barthes argues in this influential essay, \"a [...]-God) but a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture\" (146). From a parallel poststructuralist perspective, Gerard Genette has defined intertextuality as one of the forms of the larger category \"transtextuality\": \"all that sets the text in a relationship, whether obvious or con \\n REMAKING POETICS IN THE WAKE OF BORGES / 119 cealed, with other texts\" (1). Intertextuality is for him the \"first type\" of transtextu ality, \"a relationship of copresence of two texts or among several texts: that is to say, eidetically and typically as the actual presence of one text within another. In its most explicit and literal ', 'nched prejudices in the literary creation and authority of voice. With Albahari, as I discussed in chapter 3, his poetic voice was invested in writing as a matter of enunciation in the manner described by Roland Barthes in “The Death of the Author”: [...] “hold together,” suffices, that is to say, to exhaust it.12 The premise here is that the “I” is characterless and identity-less and should not consequently be typified by vocabulary that appeals to creation and origins. This chimes with Albahari’s frequent statements that language – and the form that is carved out of it – escapes from the author, that the utterance possesses an internal self-renewing principle of creation.13 It is easy to understand how this argument would have been an oblique rejection of the functionalized figure of an author in a socialist environment. It is this particular theoretical conceit of authorship that is problematized by the events of the 1990s, which, by provoking individual commentary on social affairs, dem', 'uch Pascal, The Dual Voice (wie Anm. 158), S. 43, nimmt in den Wahlverwandtschaften Passagen mit dem Charakter eines inneren Monologs wahr, schränkt aber ein: „Their grammar is of course different from that of the soliloquy in the theatre, since the [...] of the latter are replaced in the novel by the normal form of indirect speech, the third person and the tense dictated by the introductory verb (usually the past).\" 196 Friedrich, Drei Klassiker (wie Anm. 89), S. 129.

It is of course possible to see in Barthes\\' “blending and clashing” a partial des cription of Pound\\'s ideogrammic method, about which, as Korn points out in connection with the “Tradition” chapter of Guide to Kulchur, Pound was unsure himself. By his inclusion of three explanatory passages the chapter\\'s “ideogrammic purity is marred\" and reveals \"Pound\\'s loss of nerve\" [p. 124]. As Korn so rightly says, the ideogrammic method only failed when Pound broke his own declared rules and descended to the level of the \"didacticism which time and time again he had rejected，，[p. 125].

In Barthes\\' influential formulation, \"the [...]\" (1470). Barthes, \"The Death of the Author\"; Fou cault, \"What Is an Author?\"; and Achebe, \"An Image of Africa: Racism in \\n N E L L E S — Reading Conrad\\'s Trilogy 71 Conrad\\'s Heart of \\'Darkness\" are all conveniently gathered in the Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism. 4. Karl and Davies 271. Conrad develops the image of the \"note\" further in the \"Author\\'s Note\" he contributed to a 1917 edition of the book (included in John Lyon\\'s edition), extending the musical metaphor to include Heart of Dark ness. The interesting notion of Heart of Darkness as a \"foil\" to Lord Jim is not pur sued there, but of course it would not have been relevant given the omission of Lord Jim from the volume. If Conrad\\'s image carries the jeweler\\'s sense of the t', 'sis for the novel\\'s morality, Comnes seems unwilling to accept a novel which refuses to moralize. Without a central point of moral reference within the novel, Comnes looks beyond it, and in so doing demonstrates Roland Barthes\\'s contention that the \"[...]\" (143). J R poses many complex moral questions, including the question of what is worth doing, but it does not resolve them in any unequivocal way.

Reading J R as a \"tissue of quotations\" is consistent with Tabbi\\'s idea of Gaddis as a \"compositional medium,\" yet Tabbi and Comnes must ultimately view Gaddis as both the beginning \\n Screenwriting: William Gaddis\\'s I R 37 and end of the novel in order to make their arguments. \"To give a text an Author,\" Barthes writes, \"is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing\" (147).

In its continuous motion, its irreconcilable elements, its essential unresolvedness, J R defies this kind of limit. Comnes must point to Gaddis in order that there be a single point of origin for all that is contradictory within J R, and therefore a single moral voice that can contain the whole novel. In assigning ', ' another textparticularly that composed by the reader. But the fragmentary, piecemeal combination of images that initially impels a reading is also what blocks it, forming an impenetrable barrier. Barthes (1977) thus sees text stereographically, as \"[...]\" (p. 148). He so privileges the reader as writer that interpretation becomes the central role in relation to text. Text in turn is meant to provide an experience of transformation for its reader. Allegory is traditionally defined as an extended metaphor in which the characters and events in a text acquire double meaning, as in a fable or parable (see Borges or Kafka). Allegory (alios, other; agoreuei, to speak) occurs whenever one text, image, or person is doubled by another. The Old Testament becomes allegorical when it is read empathically as a préfiguration of the New Testament. A text can also \\n 426 \"WH ERE SH OULD WE BE GIN?\" double back self-consciously on itself to provide its own commentary: \"In allegorical structure, then, one tex', 'nd say whatever was on their minds\" (235). Sethe\\' s description of the house, of being in the house, almost precisely matches Roland Barthes\\'s description of the space of writing. In his (in)famous essay, \"The Death of the Author,\" Barthes describes [...]\" (142). Mirroring Barthes\\'s emphasis on writing as both timeless and identity-less, Sethe desires to \"hurry time along and get to the no-time waiting for her,\" a line that suggests her desire to escape time, and, alongside her denial of the \"other,\" the whites, to negate identity (225). In creating this parallel between Barthes\\'s description of writing and Sethe\\' s quarantine in 124, Morrison thus links Sethe\\'s intentions in 124 (denying the existence of white people) with the insidious project of white American literature: the \"ghosting,\" the \"quarantine\" of black Americans. In other words, by echoing Barthes\\'s phrasing through Sethe, Morrison ironically questions the conceit of American literature and of critics such as Barthes, who rein', 's work will at least outlive the envious erosion of time. Even in the face of death he keeps faith with his creative mission and composes a message that will reach down to posterity and pierce to the heart of mystery that is life. Charles Glicksberg [...].

To refuse \"to assign a \\'secret,\\' an ultimate meaning to the text\" is at the same time \"to [...]\" (ibid.: 147). The attempt by Althusser and his contemporaries to dissolve the author into his own discourse may sound peculiar, but it is not absurd. By focusing on the problematic as the unconscious infrastructure governing the \"production\" of the text, Althusser wishes to show that it is impossible for even the most careful author to be the sole determiner of the text\\'s meaning. Against the view that the writer has some sort of special authority over his text, Althusser argues that the writer\\'s statement of purpose is unnecessary once we have his work. Thus what Marx intends to show by argument in Capital is one thing; what he succeeds in saying is another, which can be distinguished from his point in writing it. The upshot is that the ', ' commentary on the novel is of course commonplace by now. What is not is the extent to which such celebrations of Gravity\\'s Rainbow\\'s decentered heterogeneity are \"stabilized\" by the fact that its author is, or rather has been, effectively dead. \"To [...],\" states Barthes (147). Pynchon has in a sense made opening his writing easy to do by withholding any evidence at all of his biographical existence and therefore of his originating authority. These past seventeen years Pynchon\\'s \"disappearance\" has allowed us to have it both ways in reading his work.

Yet, on the other hand, it has, precisely because Pynchon has not in fact died (surely, we trust, his death would be publicized) but only disappeared and thereby withheld ', 'g the generally accepted notion among poststructuralist critics of \"the death of the author.\" In very broad terms, these critics argue that the concept of the author as originator becomes useless once we understand, as Roland Barthes put it, \"that a [...]\" (Barthes 1977: 146). Feminist critic Cheryll Walker, however, has pointed out that questioning the death of the author would not necessarily mean returning to some sort of (patriarchal)-author criticism that would posit an individual as the origin of a text; yet \"writing is not [as Barthes would have us believe] \\'the destruction of every voice\\' but the proliferation of possibilities of hearing\" (Walker 1990: 568 [her emphases]). Walker goes on to point out that Michel Foucault\\'s concept of the \"author function,\" beyond positing what Foucault called the romantic and utopic (read: oppressive) disappearance of the author, enables us to examine and apprehend cultural, historical, and gender differences in subjectivities and authorships. It is', 'bulary of photography, that which enlarges a negative is called a “shooter” (tireur) or “marksman.” In this case, to the contrary, another shooter, who exercises a military craft, resists photography— and, for that matter, any form of publicity.

Take, for instance, Cormac McCarthy, undoubtedly one of the great American novelists of the last generation. The man was born in Providence, Rhode Island. On this account, consider Chamfort too, who wrote that “someone said that Providence is the baptismal name of chance.” It is certainly true that McCarthy ceaselessly baptizes chance in his books; it is true also that this task is daunting. But he left Providence quickly and moved to New Mexico, where he has lived ever since. He knows the desert. He certainly knows White Sands: he t', 'ng contract.\" In Wimsatt\\'s words, the \"design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable\" to critics or readers of written works (3—5). Barthes warned against extreme critical prioritization of authorial intention, arguing that \"a [...]\" (146). Though the current status of authorship is not suffering from the extreme authorial status that concerned Barthes, allowances for authorial intention and biography alongside a variety of other influences may be a rea son for the (perhaps subtle) re-emergence of the author. It is worth noting that this issue almost never surfaces with biographies, which are rarely marketed as the work of a particular author. Only when some question about truth or method arises does the biographer tend to become a media issue. The fact that in these cases it was female authors who found success in the autobio graphical form after they failed in fiction adds further weight to the argument that con temporary autobiography is considered a more likely fo', 'the news media consumer as media witness and Tulloch as media witness to his own suffering is the violent disconnection that he locates (above) between the use of his image and \"the words coming out of my mouth\"; consider the symmetry found here: as [...].

To underline this point using terms borrowed from Barthes, media texts possess an agency to disconnect \"voice\" from \"origins\" and redistribute how the suffering of the past becomes quoted into the duration of textual tissue; or, as Barthes elegantly put it \"a texts unity lies not in its origin but in its destination\" [Barthes, 1977: 148].

The novel\\'s intrigue is reduced to a sign that provokes it: a love letter handed by an anonymous traveler to a female flight attendant whom he does not know. This sign is neither plausible nor implausible; it is part of a game of chance, no more and no less. No plot is developed according to the rules of the art. What has to play out is something quite different: \"the passion for wiping out traces.\" The plot never stops pulling back, imploding, hiding itself in a magical night. It may be that the novel\\'s underlying theme-that is, the void created by an abeyance of love between Gérard and his wife, Denise - corresponds well to this eradication of the plot and its traces. It may be, too,', ' •k -k \"k \"k -k Post-structuralist work on the status of the author has its origin in two now famous essays: Roland Barthes\\'s \"The Death of the Author\" (1968) and Michel Foucault\\'s \"What is an Author?\" (1969). In a flash of bravado, Barthes declares [...]\" (142). Questioning the author\\'s status as an autonomous genius, Barthes overturns a series of hierarchical oppositions, privileging \"writing\" over \"voice,\" \"text\" over \"work,\" \"destination\" over \"origin,\" \"scriptor\" over \"author.\" Only language speaks, not the author (143), and when narration begins, \"the voice loses its origin, the author enters into his own death\" (142). Foucault, by contrast, argues that we must not cancel out the author, but rather \"seize its functions, its intervention in discourse, and its system of dependencies\" (138). Foucault traces the relationship between author and discourse to eighteenth-century economic and legal shifts that, along with the legal codification of discourse as intellectual property, led to the', \"silence women and other marginalised groups.9 There is no metaphysical certainty, and for those of you in the Reform tradition there is no textual certainty either. Texts and even readers of texts are no longer stable for as Roland Barthes says, 'we [...] a simple 'theological* meaning (the 'message' of an Author - God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash'.10 According to these voices we must free ourselves from the 'myths of 535 \\n presence' and step out proudly into a world of fragments, for that is the only world there is. Maybe, but maybe not. Certainly anyone who either is or regards themselves on the side of the poor and the voiceless has cause to agree with the post-modernist suggestion that master-narratives and 'canons of judgement' are not neutral but weighted to the interests of those groups which, historically, they have served.

Salvador Dali, for instance, praised \"the anaesthetic stare of the extremely clear eye-the lashless eye of Zeiss.\" \" And if the mechanically reproduced image can be understood as \"disinterested,\" so also might the factory-made, mass-produced object-provided that it is denatured so as to neutralize its status as a commodity intended to satisfy desire.

Lesbian space and time is thus enlarged, making more of us since, whatever our fantasy, at the moment of reading the poem, personal subjectivity is (dis)placed to be aligned with the narrator's gaze.

The poststructuralist position attributes this limiting effect to readers\\' naïve assumption that the author exists outside and prior to the text. As Barthes explains, \"The [...] ... is thought to nourish the book\" (145), while Foucault asserts that \"the author is not an indefinite source of significations that fill a work; the author does not precede the works\" (221). Counter to this restrictive tendency, Barthes conjures up the modern scriptor [who] is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no time other than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written here and now.

And yet Joyce, by producing just this atemporality, indeed imposes a final meaning, making himself, his inimitability and virtuosity, the signified of Ulysses.

He does so in order to reaf', 'e condemned any attempt to use the author as a reference point for understanding the work, championing instead the reader\\'s complete freedom in the presence of the text and declaring that the idea of the author is, in any case, a modern construct, a [...] person.\" 44 Seen from such a perspective, Zeami as an author is a modern, Western, ideologically motivated invention of the kind deplored by Masao Miyoshi, 41. Stephen Orgel in \"What is a Text?\" Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama, Vol. 24 (1981), pp. 3, 6; quoted by Jerome J. McGann, A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 130, note 5. With respect to no, the two texts of Unrin\\'in (the one in Zeami\\'s own hand, although not necessarily by him, and the quite different modern version) are a vivid, if extreme, reminder of the problem. See the discussion by Thomas B. Hare, Zeami\\'s Style: The Noh Plays of Zeami Motokiyo (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1986), pp. 55-58; and the transl', 'o close the writing’.1 Furthermore, this shift in understanding the relationship between author and text fundamentally alters the temporality of authorship itself. In the more traditional understanding of the author, Barthes explains, the author ‘is [...]’. By contrast, the modern author (whom Barthes refers to as a ‘scriptor’) ‘is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written here and now’.2 For Barthes, the past-ness of the traditional author and the implicit causality of the author–text relationship pose untenable limits on interpretation. Instead, by shifting focus to the reader, Barthes sought to disburden the text from the oppressive force of intention. Foucault would similarly contend in his essay ‘What Is an Author?’ that it is readers who construct authors: the author, he writes, ‘does not ', 'he world truthfully and in detail. Both these principles are called into question in the statements I wish to cite. The first is from Roland Barthes\\' essay, \"The Death of the Author\" (1968). He seeks to replace \"author\" with the term \"scriptor\": The [...] here and now....

To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing\" (p. 256).

Without a God-like \"Author\" - and the authority that implies over what a literary text can mean - deriving a \"fixed meaning\" from a literary text becomes virtually impossible. As Richter has observed, Barthes demonstrated in S/Z: An Essay (1970) that \"any genuinely complete analysis of a fictional text ', 'ct discourse. The narrator transfers that telepathic knowledge to the reader. George Eliot’s narrator speaks in the third person past tense for what Dorothea Brooke and all the other characters are presumed to have experienced in the past and in the [...]. Though the characters evolve through time, the cores of their selfhoods remain the same. The name “Dorothea” goes on referring to something unified and perdurable. Dorothea’s insight into other people is at first limited and laughably mistaken, as in her radical misreading of her first husband, Mr. Casaubon. Gradually she learns to read others more accurately and to sympathize with them. That change leads to the happy ending and makes it possible. An epistolary novel differs from novels like Middlemarch in having, typically, no overt narrator. Nevertheless, the presence 21 \\n going postcard of a supervising and ordering consciousness is implied in the way the letters are put in a sequence that tells a unified story.

In the literary milieu of Paris, where Barthes lived, attention to language had replaced attention to the users of language. The old centreing on the author, said Barthes, had to end. He announced the death of the author. Writing, he said, destroys the very concept of author, or voice. Looking outside Europe, Barthes understood that in non- Western societies “the responsibility for a narrative is never assumed by a person but by a mediator, shaman or reciter ...” (49).

There is something else the text reveals: after various close readings, we can identify with no difficulty some of Carl', 'rative, any cohesiveness, any connection with source. This detachment, figured as an attempt \\'to seal its meaning\\' independent of its origin, reads surprisingly like Barthes\\'s account in his now canonical essay \\'The Death of the Author\\'. He states: \\'[...].\\'22 The argument continues: As soon as a fact is narrated no longer with a view to acting directly on reality but intransitively that is to say finally outside of any function other than that of the very practice of the symbol itself, this disconnection occurs, the voice loses its origin, the author enters into his own death, writing begins.23 The resonance here is clear. Writing is an act of slippage, a break from the \\'narrative \"tree\"\\'. McGuckian\\'s leaf seems to be \\'the very practice of the symbol itself, detaching itself from origin, its sealed meaning the beginning of writing. This \\'sealing\\', however, is not quite Barthesian. For Barthes, the death of the author introduces multiple meanings: the inevitable detachment that constitutes w', 'l subject\" (Kamuf 5). Probably the source of this controversial slogan is Barthes\\' precisely titled, brief essay, \"The Death of the Author,\" in which he charts the postmodern move from a literature \"tyrannically centred on the author.... [where] the [...] it,\" to the ascendancy of the reader (143). When Barthes replaces the terms authori scriptor with critic/reader, he suggests that the future movement of literary theory requires the author\\'s death to enable the reader\\'s birth. Foucault, also making a distinction between the author and what happens in the text, offers the term author-function as being outside and preceding the text itself. True, the author is maker of text, but disappears once this function is performed, only the \"function\" remaining, that is, being outside and preceding the text. In this role the author must accept obliteration in the text. Whereas the author in the epic form accepted early death because the epic itself would bring immortality, Foucault says that \"modem\" w', ' Magnin, and others (Anginot 1995). 5. This is not to say that a poststructuralist such as Barthes cannot be guilty of essentializing authorship. He proposes the following as a reductive foil to the modem, Western model of the autonomous author: \"In [...] his genius\" (1967:142). 6. This liberatory aspect of Barthes\\'s and Foucault\\'s critiques of authorship resonated with the contemporary Western art of their time, especially conceptual art. Sean Burke (1998) provides a useful analysis of Barthes\\'s and Foucault\\'s texts and a survey of their many critics. 7. See considerations of the collaborative aspect of Keita\\'s work by Okwui Enwezor and Octavio Zaya (in Bell et al. 1996:33) and Kobena Mercer (1995), as well as Susan Vogel\\'s discussion of it as a shared quality of African portrait photography (1991:116). 8. Keita dates his work according to his fabric backdrops. In 1949-52 he used a fringed bedspread; in 1952-55 a backdrop with a small floral print; in 1956 a backdrop with a bold leaf patte', 'he writer himself \"is no more than a text rereading itself as it rewrites itself\\' ( Desire 86-87). Similarly, Roland Barthes advances a theory of intertextuality that depends entirely on the reader as the organizing center of interpretation, \"as the [...]\" (148). To the study of the intertextual field between readers and writers, Hans Robert Jauss adds a historical dimension by focusing on the ways different readers\\' horizons diverge from one another over time since the succession of works is mediated not only through the producing subject but also through the consuming subject (15). Michel Foucault\\'s conception of intertextuality contributes a political component by focusing on the ways that the social realm saturates the literary object, and he insists that we analyze the role of power in the production of textuality and of textuality in the production of power. In particular, Foucault\\'s observations on the manifestations of \"differences\" in class and gender have specific resonance when r', 'cording to this current school of thought, the voice emerging from the narrative, far from being the expression of an autonomous individual, is a very complex discursive phenomenon. Indeed, Roland Barthes contends in \"Death of the Author\" that \"(w)e [...].\"3 Barthes argues that the reader, or the spectator for film, rather than the author is the source of signification. The author\\'s status is further diminished by the conception of the text as a blend and clash of unoriginal, culturally coded writings. Defining an author, Barthes suggests, \"is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing.\"4 Clearly, within the context of commercial cinema, the identification of an author continues to be crucial to us. As a popular audience we demand that the polysemy of the text Christine Saxton is assistant professor in the Film Department at San Francisco State University. Cinema Journal 26, No. 1, Fall 1986 1 9 \\n be suppressed and that the film pretend to mon', 'sn’t exist outside language itself. Examining a sentence by Balzac, Barthes finds it is impossible to pin down just who is talking. Is it the story’s protagonist? Balzac the individual? Balzac the writer? Balzac trying to impersonate a woman? “Is it [...]” (1968, 142). Barthes believes that a text is “not a line of words releasing a single ‘theological’ meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-God) but a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash” (146). In response to this bad news for authors, postmodern (q.v.) writers have turned to parody and pastiche—an appropriate technique for our cut-and-paste world. They make fun of style, although in the hands of someone like Mark Leyner, that tactic quickly becomes a style in itself. Their critique of voice as an artificial construct has more weight. After all, identity politics (q.v.) inevitably plays a huge role in who gets to speak, what they are capable of saying, and how what they have to say is', 'ion or mad camaraderie—a number of questions are ignored. While T. S. Eliot suggests all successful authors learn from and join the tradition, Roland Barthes suggests—equally problematically—that the Author is more likely a site of contestation: “We [...]’ meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture” (1968, 149). Given the choice of chaos or certainty, most writers would opt for the latter, but they do so by relying on received images that certainly leave a number of would-be authors out of the picture or forced to remake themselves into writer types that won’t serve them well. Katharine Haake (2000, 191) reminds us that “we turn out the way we are by virtue of our experience in culture, in class, in gender, in race, in family, in history, in being” (see also “Identity Politics”), which predicts that novice write', 'f lifeless signs into meanings. It is on the basis of this understanding that a concourse can emerge between art and Being. But that is not the usual way things go in a modernist philosophy of art. Roland Barthes, for example, famously averred that “[...].”41 Barthes is glossing the idea, going back at least to the Phaedrus, that writing throws up a barrier between souls. Socrates (or Plato) thought that the problem was specifi cally with writing, an act that dries up dialectic’s lifeblood; with Barthes, it seems as if the signs are dead to begin with, that the problem is with language itself, spoken as much as written. Yet language, Goehring.indd 70 5/17/2018 4:56:55 PM \\n on being ❧ 71 including writing, can also open up our psychic life to ourselves and to others. Words are like gondoliers of the soul, as someone once said. To be able to put a name to a feeling is to mature, to recognize one’s self and others more fully. That is what Ian McEwan is getting at in The Innocent in describing ', 'post)romantic discourses of authorship often presuppose the f initeness of, and indissoluble tie between, an author and his or her oeuvre (Bennett 2005: 55). As Roland Barthes (1977: 147) famously observed in his essay The Death of the Author, ‘[t]o [...] it with a f inal signif ied, to close the writing’. Yet the process of authorial branding is characterized precisely by a proliferation of meaning (which can, but does not necessarily have to be controlled by a managerial strategy, as the next section will show) and a disconnection of author and text. After all, Bukowski did not author the phrase ‘What would Bukowski do?’, but it is nonetheless an undeniable product of the signifying potential of his oeuvre. Likewise, his work does not contain references to, for instance, the ‘Bukowski Tavern’, but his name has been effectively aff ixed to the restaurants bearing that name in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a mark of quality. It is this productive, expansive dimension of branded au', 'intentional fallacy, after which the thread is taken up in the 1960s and 1970s by semiotic and poststructuralist theorists who conceptualize the Author as merely a shorthand rhetorical conceit, a figure of speech that, as Roland Barthes maintains, “[[...].”30 For Michel Foucault, that restriction of expression performs an ideological function “by [impeding] the free circulation, the free manipulation, the free composition, decomposition, and recomposition” of the text.31 The struggle to liberate prose and poetry from determinate meaning originating from an Author involves a kind of theatricalizing of the paged text, unlocking its potential for the unbounded play of signification.32 Like the interference of theater artists, managers, and critics, the “death of the Author” paradigm dissolves any hope for the writer of agency over the work. Copyright only protects the text and the Author temporarily before the inevitable transformation of writer into puppet. Read in this context, Shakes Versus', 'velopments along the lines of James Jones or Kerouac. Yet even that fantasy is anachronistic and nostalgic; all those unexplored interstices of the system, which allowed the lumpens of the 50s to become, in their turn, figures of \"the Great American [...] been absorbed into the sealed and achieved space of consumer society. (Or if you prefer, the as yet unregistered and unexpressed experiences which the beats were able to discover on the margins of the system have themselves-along with the very figure and role of the beat writer as such-become part of the culture and its stereotypes: as with black writing and women\\'s writing, it is what has never been seen which enables the production of a new language--\"affirmative culture\" then ever more rapidly catches up, assimilates all those things into what everybody knows, maps out the unexplored, turns everything for which you still lacked words into so many consumable images.) The very content of the star system itself, as it inscribes itself in K', 'on. However, it does tend to give a jolly sense that there is room for everything in the cornucopia of heteroglossia which does not always suit well with the hostilely deconstructive relations many parodies set up between texts. Barthes argues that \"[...] this is an extreme view if applied to all straight and much parodie writing, it captures the quality of many parodies (for example, A Tale of a Tub, Margaret Atwood\\'s Handmaid\\'s Tale, Kathy Acker\\'s Don Quixote, and Thomas Pynchon\\'s Gravity\\'s Rainbow) better than a model based on the linguistic plenitude of heteroglossia. Parody is often made up of multiple absences rather than multiple presences, and it often exhausts the discourses it inhabits rather than replenishing them. A way of imagining this basic trope of parody in its negative form is to read it as deconstruction and, more precisely, as a play of diff?rance. Again, we have to read past the Derridean proposition that diff?rance is a transcendental principle implicit in all language', 'ries of supra-individual spiritual authorship and of the world-as-text have interesting points in common with Roland Barthes\\' contention in \"The Death of the Author\" that the role of the author is that of mere scriptor, someone who \"is born with the [...]\" (145). In contrast to T. S. Eliot\\'s and Harold Bloom\\'s theories of authorship that put the emphasis on the relationship between the dead masters and the individual writer, Roland Barthes-and the poststructuralist and deconstructivist critics after himcontends that what confers reality on the individual (as author/reader) is the text, defined as a pre-existing and all-enveloping intertext, endlessly begetting and trapping within itself writers and readers alike (136). 5 According to Gabriel Josipovici this kind of (modernist) textual labyrinth still has a numinous capacity: \"The book becomes an object among many in the 51 \\n TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE room. Open and read, it draws the reader into tracing the contours of his own labyrinth ', 'vert authorial presence as less than desirable, speaks of the \"intruding author\" (125).4 As Roland Barthes and others have pointed out, a radical conflict exists between the author as subject and the reader as subject. If, as Barthes maintains, the \"[...]\" (123), how do author and reader, both strongly present in Don Sandalio, coexist? The answer, convincingly argued by Navajas, lies in unstated authorial intent, in an unacknowledged desire by the author to control the agency of the reader: \"Unamuno no quiere verse texrualizado. Por eso, se apresura a textualizar a los dem?s, a desrealizarlos en su realidad individual [...] para transformarlos seg?n su sistema y hacerlos parte de ?l\" (516). According to Navajas, the novels of Unamuno lead the reader to believe that a cooperative author/ reader relationship is being established and then proceed to undermine that relationship. Navajas explains: \"Los textos de Unamuno reconocen la inevitabilidad del lector pero la circunscriben y limitan y, en', 'ncept of death seemed to militate against considering the gender, race, or geographical origins of the author as part of the text. But the essay begins with a quotation from Sarrasine that is very much about the question of sexual difference: In his [...], herfuss ings, and her delicious sensibility.\" Who is speaking thus? Is it the hero of the story bent on remaining ignorant of the castrato hidden beneath the woman? Is it Balzac the individual, furnished by his personal experience with a philosophy of Woman? Is it Balzac the author professing \"literary\" ideas on femininity? Is it universal wisdom? Romantic psychology? (142) The death of the author is somehow based on the dissociation of the forces that con struct the \"naturalness\" of femininity. To ask \"who is speaking?\" is to see sexual dif ference as constructed, not given; a discourse learned, not a person perceived. Giving voice to a sigh about femininity, Balzac the author falls apart. If all those sighs that emanate from our deepest', 'zac, describing a castrato disguised as a woman, \\n Bringing Out D. A.

(142) The death of the author is somehow based on the dissociation of the forces that con struct the \"naturalness\" of femininity. To ask \"who is speaking?\" is to see sexual dif ference as constructed, not given; a discourse learned, not a person perceived. Giving voice to a sigh about femininity, Balzac the author falls apart. If all those sighs that emanate from our deepest feelings are just echoes of sentences we have learned somewhere, though, then we ourselves fall apart in the same way. This was the rea son the court that prosecuted Flaubert for the immorality of Madame Bovary was most worried about free indirect discourse, not adultery. Who is speaking? Who does speak? Where does the authority in the novel come from? What kind of kn', ' know is a trap? These are the assumptions of culture and literature, though?how could they be a trap? How can this sentence about femininity be both a lie and a truth? Barthes continues the paragraph: \"We shall never know [who is speaking], for the [...] ing\" (142). This at first seems like a homophobic Aufhebung of the question. Espe cially since, at bottom, Balzac\\'s story is about castration. That is probably why the essay itself was so influential?it opened the closet door a crack, and then allowed what could be seen from there to become generalized in such a way as to slam it shut. The neuter, or neutral, space of writing can be understood that way, and Miller\\'s book is partly a response to that reading. The later Barthes, it is said, ac knowledged gay desire more and more. Miller writes to bring out the gayness of even the early Barthes. And he does so irrefutably. But even there, might Barthes not also be talking about the sexiness of writing in a different sense? What if \"the nega t', '6 pages long. The idea of authorial absence has come up. I won\\'t try to get into this, except to mention this world of Barthes and Paul de Man and so forth.

Barthes calls for a new criticism that foregrounds precisely what traditional criticism has heretofore ignored – namely, the reader – and he closes the essay writing, “the [...]” (148). In the reception history of Effi Briest, Fontane’s own appraisal of the novel’s moral conundrum gives way to a readerly consensus that sees it quite differently. \\n In Spite of Altruism: Empathy and Disgust in the Reception of Effi Briest 165 6 Rolf Zuberbühler reflects further on Fontane’s sympathy for “the natural,” that is, for human weakness and fallibility, and his aversion to “Tugendmeier,” especially with regard to female characters such as Effi (9). 7 Krohn comments on the vagueness and abstraction in Innstetten’s language, writing that his rationale relies on “semantisch weitgehend leere Konzepte” (160). 8 For Fontane, Widmann is one of the most astute contemporaneous readers of Effi Briest because his review emphasizes th', 'antiquity, the source of authority,\" relays the tomb\\'s present and future, while the combiner\\'s effort is mirrored in the way it is based on a limitless analysis, breaking and recomposing a work of the past into a brand new work. The \"modern writer ([...],\" Barthes says. \"There is no other time than that of the utterance.\"17 By repeating \"a gesture forever anterior, never original,\" the facsimile aligns itself with the public performances of the ancient rhapsody, where substantial parts of itinerant yet uncodified texts were continuously disseminated to new live audiences. It comes as no surprise that Plato did his very best to corrupt the virtues of the professional rhapsodist. With his characteristic pedantry, irony, and evil logic, Socrates is confusing, tricking, and mocking the celebrated rhapsodist Ion from Ephesus, who has just arrived in Athens to compete in the rhapsodic contest at the Panathenaic festival by performing the same Homeric recitation that had just won him the golden c', \"thority figure; nor is he instilling his novels with didactic lifestyle instructions for expectant and gender-neutral readers to discover within the text as they turn the pages; nor is he proclaiming that, as far as interpretation is concerned, the '[...] of the Author' (Barthes, 1977: 148). Rather than asserting or relinquishing control of the meaning-making project, Konadu's brief definition of the popular novelist's role makes a different, culturally specific statement about the interpretive process in Ghana-for he appears to take for granted a mode of reception in which authors and audiences share responsibility for the production of meaning. Konadu defines his primary reading constituency as a clear-cut social class: 'mainly I have the youth in mind because . . . the people who in fact buy [local publications] are the youngmen' (1974). By referring to the 'youngman' he targets a group of men identifiable by their age (17-35), unmarried status, secondary education and relatively low fin\", 'ntext. He argues that authorship is an illusion, and that the structure of all texts is quotational; i.e. that there are no authors in an epistemological sense who (via their unique, original work) can provide a singular final meaning in a text: The [...] on any one of them. ... Once the Author is removed, the claim to decipher a text becomes quite futile. To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases: society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author has been found, the text is explained—victory to the critic.4 Within this description it is also possible to recognize the concept of collage, montage, sampling or appropriation— 4 Barthes, “The Death of the Author,” 142–148. \\n 05: THE VALORIZATION OF THE AUTHOR 81 “his only power is to mix”—a conception of autho', 's indicates precisely the truth of writing, the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original.

Fragmentation and subsequent recombination define all semiosis: the production model it provides is serial in nature—a transformation of individual elements through their arrangement into novel patterns governed by past experience and previous examples of type; it is semiotic product', 'ut in interrelation with other texts through quotations, references, allusions and influences of various kinds.4 The intersubjective influence conveyed through the medium of a “text” is clearly seen in the “various cultural discourses”5 because “the [...]”.6 The assumed locus of meaning-production in this inter-subjective process has shifted from the author to the reader. Both axis of intertextuality––via the writer (who is the first reader) and the readers (who are co-producers of textual meaning)––allow the “dialogism” or “heteroglossia” (exchange of language in M. Bakhtin’s understanding) of texts to work in the genesis of meaning.7 The processes of readingand meaning-production are always dialogues between the writers and the readers. The authority of interpretation does not reside in the frozen text or in the first writer, but is to be found in the interactive process of the text, involving both the writer and the reader, which I have previously termed “rhetorical interaction”. 8 Gadam', 'e so evident to scholars of subsequent periods. When Julia Kristeva referred to the text as a \"mosaic of citations, which absorbed and transformed its individual components,\" or when Barthes called it a \"tissue of quotations\" and a \"multidimensional [...],\" or when Jacques Derrida described it as an archive of \"always already transcriptions\" (or the \"always-already-read,\" according to Fredric Jameson), these authors were all drawing from a classical topos of eclectic imitation outlined by authors long before them.8 Predating postmodernism by over three hundred years, the Baroque theorist Secondo Lancellotti pointed out, \"There are many books in one book, and many authors speak through the mouth of one author.\" Crediting Aristotle as his own point of reference, Lancellotti explained that this type of \\n 478 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 1 Sherrie Levine, After Walker Evans (no. 21), black-and-white photograph.

The more-than qualities of the dead relative’s hun live on as the ginseng is steeped into longevity tea. “The writer can only imitate a gesture,” says Barthes in his essay, “Death of the Author,” “that is [...].”2 Barthes insists that an author – the subject doing the writing – does not exist prior to or outside of language, that is, it is the writing that is anterior to the author. The identifiable body of the author is only along for the ride. For Barthes, there is no subject to throw under, nor is there an authority to do the throwing (although, the irony of Barthes’s own death – he succumbed to injuries after he was struck by a laundry van – does not go unnoticed as a subject). Instead, “[The author’s] only power is to mix writings [...] in such a way as never to rest on any one of them.”3 This is a challenging reorientation.

What if that vacuity were the whole point? “Why should not this anonymous, author-less speech, which does not take the form of books, which passes and wishes to pass, alert us to something important, about which literature also wishes to speak to us?”104 An implausible hint: “a point', 'God-like status bestowed on the author by much traditional criticism, Barthes insists instead on the power of language itself. “It is language which speaks, not the author”; he maintains, “to write is, through a prerequisite impersonality [. . .] to [...], ‘performs’, and not ‘me’ [the author]” (“Death” 143); and he goes on to claim that literature “has no other origin than language itself, language which ceaselessly calls into question all origins” (146). The idea of empowering language is suggested again in Barthes’s inaugural lecture at the Collège de France (delivered in 1977), especially when he declares that “language [...] is neither reactionary nor progressive,” that it is “quite simply fascist” (461). This suggestion of language as a kind of monolithic underlying system, indebted perhaps to Ferdinand de Saussure’s notion of langue, is swiftly displaced in favour of a more nuanced and pragmatic concentration on different functions that language can serve depending on particular con', 'ith respect to his audience. For Williams, London is at his best i.e., most sincere—when his characters embody (or spiritually channel?) the ethical concerns and radical social critique of the author. Quoting from Roland Barthes in \"The Death of the [...] deciphered\\'—Williams posits, \"There exists a relationship between the living figure of Jack Lon don and his representations of authors and author figures, but it is not the one-to-one correspondence of a code.\" Indeed, Williams\\'s reading of the complexity of London\\'s authorship exemplifies what Barthes calls the \"composite\" nature of writing in his playfully complex analogies and sub stitutions among the roles of author, co-author, narrator, character, editor, and publisher. We can see the complexity of Williams\\'s thinking even in his chapter ti tles, which simultaneously suggest at least two ways of looking at a period of London\\'s authorship, in addition to positing intertextual meanings. For example, the plural subject of Chapter 4, \"Son', 'r texts that openly contradict themselves, maintaining first one thing and then another and then still another (Booth, 1985). Both subject and text offer multiple opportunities for representation, emergences, comment, and speechlessness. Any self or [...]\" (Barthes, 1977, p. 146). New writing needs to be appreciated on its own terms rather than from the traditional stance that writers who \"experiment textually\" are somehow \"abdicat[ing] their responsibilities as qualitative [researchers]\" (Denzin, 1997b, p. 5). Teacher researchers who experiment with arts-based, literary forms may create the conditions for locating new epiphanies within texts and people\\'s lives. Their texts and selves are manifestations of consciousness and artifacts to be analyzed and responded to. However, unlike a best selling romance, a postmodernist work cannot be judged in terms of its transparency, generalizability, and marketability. \"In principle [it cannot] be governed by preestablished rules, and it cannot be jud', '60).

Couched in its flatbed surface there is a random collection of heterogeneous objects: a red umbrella, stripped from its frame and splayed like a fan; rusted sheet metal, crumpled into a cascade of metallic drapery and mounted on mirrors; red block lettering, apparently from a broadside that has been ripped apart and dispersed; swatches of fabric; bits of clothing.

Because the authorial voice has been so thoroughly displaced, Coetzee seems to be trying and self-consciously failing to assert the idea that Roland Barthes discusses in \"The Death of the Author\": \"It is [...] is to read, through preliminary impersonality - which we can at no moment identify with the realistic novelist\\'s castrating \\'objectivity\\' - that point where not T but language, performs\" (50). At the same time that language does \"perform\" so as to usurp any power Susan might have over the purpose of her writing, we find out more about Susan through the text than we do about what happened on the island. Still, even though in Foe we do not recognize Daniel Foe as the \"I\" of the novel, Susan trusts him as the author of Foe. Coetzee is saying that even though language does function beyond the \"I,\" there is always an implied \"I\" just beneath the surface of the ink on the page, because writing is an authoritative act. In Foe Daniel Foe and Coetz', 'ments argued that the study of literature ought to focus on the immanent properties of texts, and were thus strictly limited to literary interpretation.

The former term corresponds to the traditional conception of the author as ‘the [...]’ (Barthes, 2002, p. 5). The scriptor, by contrast, ‘is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written here and now’ (ibid., p. 5). The death of the author, then, obviously does not refer to an empirical fact. It is, as Burke notes, ‘a call to arms and not a funeral oration’ (2008, p. 27). Barthes urges us to approach literary works in a new way: We should seize the initiative as readers and not grant the biographical author mastery of the text. We should think of all of literature as one massive text, an interlinked fabric with threads to be traced ', 'r. The Author is thought to nourish the book, which is to say that he exists before it, thinks, suffers, lives for it, is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his child’ (Barthes, 2002, p. 5). The scriptor, by contrast, ‘is [...] here and now’ (ibid., p. 5). The death of the author, then, obviously does not refer to an empirical fact. It is, as Burke notes, ‘a call to arms and not a funeral oration’ (2008, p. 27). Barthes urges us to approach literary works in a new way: We should seize the initiative as readers and not grant the biographical author mastery of the text. We should think of all of literature as one massive text, an interlinked fabric with threads to be traced in all directions, rather than some chronology of distinct works with precise meanings we can unearth one by one with the aid of each creator’s life and design. This is a rather counterintuitive form of reading, however, and Peter Lamarque is surely right that it tends to be ‘more interesting, m', ' suggestion, an invitation, a manifesto, a strategic hypothesis, or speculative experiment, yet it is largely framed as a statement of fact. For example, Barthes writes assertively, as if he were announcing a philosophical breakthrough, that ‘We now [...]” meaning (the “message” of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash’ (2002, p. 6), that ‘it is language which speaks, not the author’ (ibid., p. 4), and that ‘a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination’ (ibid., p. 7). Burke is right, however, that ‘the decision as to whether we read a text with or without an author remains an act of critical choice governed by the protocols of a certain way of reading rather than any “truth of writing”’ (2008, p. 169). Copyright law’s utilitarian function means that ‘ought’ and ‘is’ are reasonably distinct most of the time, and we can bring either dimension into sharp focus: First, we can adopt a normative perspec', 'argely framed as a statement of fact. For example, Barthes writes assertively, as if he were announcing a philosophical breakthrough, that ‘We now know that a text is not a line of words releasing a single “theological” meaning (the “message” of the [...]’ (2002, p. 6), that ‘it is language which speaks, not the author’ (ibid., p. 4), and that ‘a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination’ (ibid., p. 7). Burke is right, however, that ‘the decision as to whether we read a text with or without an author remains an act of critical choice governed by the protocols of a certain way of reading rather than any “truth of writing”’ (2008, p. 169). Copyright law’s utilitarian function means that ‘ought’ and ‘is’ are reasonably distinct most of the time, and we can bring either dimension into sharp focus: First, we can adopt a normative perspective, and reflect on what copyright’s primary purpose(s) should be, or on the fairness or effectiveness of a certain provision.

The position of the concrete poets in the decade previous to Barthes\\'s essay was also sympathetic to this position, though it came more out of a technological determinism than a theoretical response to the ideas of structuralism. Concrete poetry sought to undercut the position of the author in order to compose mass poetry, able to be quickly and collectively consumed. Such a strategy is articulated in Gomringer\\'s manifestos, but it is also 11. See, for example, Hiršal and Grogerová\\'s Job-boj (1960-62), Bense\\' s \"Statistical Text\" (1966) (Solt 122), and Campos\\'s \"Alea I - Variações Semánticas (Uma Epicomédia de Bólso)\" (1967) (Solt 105-6) for evidence of concrete poetry\\'s engagement with mechanical approaches to language. While', 'n it. Language speaks us; writing writes us; etc. Hix makes little mention of Heidegger\\'s Poetry, Language, Thought or Derrida\\'s Margins of Philosophy, where all this stuff is set out most clearly, but he does quote enough Barthes-\"To write is... to [...],\\' and not \\'me\\'\"-so you get the idea that author-as-owner is not just superfluous but contradictory, and enough Foucault-\\'The writing of our day has freed itself from the necessity of \\'expression\\'; [it is] an interplay of signs, regulated less by the content it signifies than by the very nature of the signifier\"-so you see that even the New Critics\\' Holy Text disappears as the unitary lodestone of meaning and value. For Hix\\'s teacher, trying to attribute writing\\'s meaning to a static text or a human author is like trying to knit your own body, your own needles. Hix has an even better sartorial image: \"Previously, the text was a cloth to be unraveled by the reader; if the cloth were unwound all the way, the reader would find the author holdi', 'physics by expelling “being as presence.”31 A few years later, Roland Barthes could provide the following improvisation, which varies the theme by metaphorically identifying the disruptive character of writing with its material or bodily character: “[...].”32 Julia Kristeva makes use of Lacanian psychoanalysis—a Freudianism transformed by phenomenology—to push the corporeal metaphorics of writing even further. Kristeva channels a psychoanalytic conception of bodily drives into the linguistic domain via her conception of the semiotic. This is understood as a presignificatory dimension of language in which the drives are discharged through such things as rhythm and tone, standing thus in opposition to the dimension she calls the “symbolic,” the domain of meaning supported by syntax.33 In all of these versions, the Husserlian thematics of identity—the “natural” identity perpetuated through the occlusion of infinite being (the other) and the epiphanic identity briefly attained through its irrup', 'line descending from the Bible, a situation in which reading is intimidated from the outset. It is against the memory of this situation that contemporary readers often define themselves, as when Barthes heralds the replace ment of the transcendental [...].\"12 But the idea of the scriptor is not the invention of the \"last few years\"; it is the most ancient of authorial principles, de fining not only the provisional \"author\" of oral-formulaic narratives or poems but also the author of the Biblical text itself: God \"filled\" Moses with himself, remaining impeccably absent from the text, serv ing Moses in the same way that the dictionary serves Barthes\\' scriptor as the reservoir from which the writing is drawn. For Barthes, the death of the author has cleared the way for the birth of the reader, whom \"the new writing\" has unearthed from the debris of \"Classical criticism.\"13 For readers of the Confessions, how ever, this renaissance is unnecessary.

Of course textuality itself imposes ab sence: as Barthes wrote, \"[...] origin.\"31 Yet theatrical alertness to occasion and a performative sense of self inform Jonson\\'s management of this enigma: he constructs the author as a figure who presents himself and recedes. In the Epigrams, readers find themselves at once privy to the speaker\\'s as-if intimate ad dress and marginalized by its aim to other persons, while the collection removes Jonson, its arranger, to a bookish distance. Exploiting his other-directedness—finally his absence—in the text, Jonson signals that wise readers will understand his silences and meet his mind in an elite place beyond language.32 The antirepresentational realm he postulates \\n 514 Richmond Barbour is built, that is, from relations constructed in the medium of representa tion.

While writing Radetzkymarsch Roth was often overcome with doubt in his ability as a writer and the worth o', 'is against the historical antecedents particular to their object of study. Temporary Entombment Edgar Allan Poe did not just die. Rather, he was murdered. In his 1967essay, Barthes argued that literary criticism should no longer centeritself “on the [...].”7 Would Barthes, whose repetition reads like homicidal conviction, not present himself as the prime suspect to Poe’s murder? Confirming that suspicion, the 6 P O E S T U D I E S \\n H O L L O W C O F F I N Frenchman betrays something like a confession: “the birth of the reader,” he wrote, “must be at the cost of the death of the Author.”8 While Poe scholarship still persists long after the author’s biological termination, his authorial corpse—like that of Madeline Usher—has been sealed within a crypt below the house, behind a door of “immense weight” (PT, 329). Critical “glances, however, rested not long upon the dead,” as Barthes, like Roderick Usher, screwed shut the coffin and secured the massive iron door behind him as he left, isolatin', 'ica; it also speaks to that particular moment in French theory which obliterated Poe’s authorship while rendering its own kind of democratic imperative. Given that Barthes (followed by Deleuze and Guattari) would describe text as a “multidimensional [...],”15 and that Jefferson believed democratic America to be comprised of similarly “inherent and inalienable rights,” such a theoretical leveling could possibly situate the tale of “Usher” and its house as both the paragon of text and the avatar of an ideally democratic America. This perspective—that the text of Poe’s tale might speak to an American ideal by way of admittedly serendipitous analogies—will require some formal justification with reference to the whole of the text. Even though Poe contests the pretense that “an American should confine himself to American themes, or even prefer them,”16 scholars have argued that Poe’s tales were composed with the idea of an American literature in mind insofar as they assert national sentiments, “n', '[...] . . Barthes, \"The Death of the Author\" \"Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,\" perhaps Borges\\' most anthologized story, narrates the interjection of one world into another or, to be more precise, of a fictitious world into the order of reality. The fabulous planet of Tlon is a fiction contrived by an obscure collectivity of scriptors who record in a meticulous encyclopedia the planet\\'s topography and metaphysics, its languages and literatures. The anonymity of the authors is in accord with the literary orthodoxy of Tlon, where The idea of a single subject is . . . all-powerful. It is uncommon for books to be signed. The concept of plagiarism does not exist: it has been established that all works are the creation of one author, who is atemporal and a', ' the historical figure helps resolve whatever intellectual complexities American Photographs might present. This sort of \"author-and-his-work\" conflation is common in historical and critical writing. Roland Barthes complained some time ago that \"the [...] . . . the voice of a single person, the author.\" In practice, the author\\'s (or artist\\'s) name encompasses more than just the individual who put pen to paper or brush to canvas: it designates the rhetorical personage who lives, acts, and intends through and within the pages of the historian\\'s text. It points to the inventory of qualities associated with that author\\'s corpus (the Shakespearian, the Claudian, the Wagnerian) and used to describe and unify the character of this personage. \"Critics doubtless try to give this intelligible being a realistic status,\" writes Michel Foucault. \"Nevertheless, these aspects of an individual which we designate as making him an author are only a projection . . . of the traits we establish as pertinent, th', ' sexuality.28 Acker\\'s focus on embodiment is relayed through the numerous identities her narrator undertakes: \"I\\'m trying to become other people because this is what I find interesting\" (p. 88). Kathy becomes other people through the language of the [...] phrases \"I\\'m born,\" \"I become,\" and \"My name is.\" She becomes a series of murderesses, pornographic characters, men, and a performer named Silver Gold Lamé. The female narrator relays the story under authorial names - as both Kathy, the fictionalized person of the historical author, and the Black Tarantula, the pseudonymous author - as well as under the names of fictional and historical figures. Through the repetition of language, the narrator becomes specific historical and fictional people and things. She does not merely become a murderess, or murderesses, she becomes Charlotte Wood, Sophie Dawes, and Laura Lane. She becomes not just any male writer but specifically Alexander Trocchi, William Butler Yeats, and the Marquis de Sade. This v', 'other words, this is the creative, authorial function: the author as the one who imagines and writes the words. The hermeneutic complement that this model of creativity supposes is the author as an autonomous individual with personal intention: \"The [...]...the voice of a single person, the author \\'confiding\\' in us\" (\"The Death\" 143). The author is the creative origin of the words, and therefore (s)he is the one who is \\n PHILLIPS / 403 able to provide the truth of what the words mean. Because of this, the reader frequently refers back to the author\\'s biography and bibliography in order to find the intended meaning. This is the authoritative function: the author as the sole origin of the work who thus determines the meaning of the words.

In The Visible Word (1994), Johanna Drucker describes the \"unmarked text,\" which is \"the domin', 'e hermeneutic complement that this model of creativity supposes is the author as an autonomous individual with personal intention: \"The explanation of a work is always sought in the man or woman who produced it, as if it were always in the end...the [...]\" (\"The Death\" 143). The author is the creative origin of the words, and therefore (s)he is the one who is \\n PHILLIPS / 403 able to provide the truth of what the words mean. Because of this, the reader frequently refers back to the author\\'s biography and bibliography in order to find the intended meaning. This is the authoritative function: the author as the sole origin of the work who thus determines the meaning of the words. Although Barthes does not explicitly consider this, the Romantic author\\'s authority over the work is presented and maintained by the visual appearance of the text. In The Visible Word (1994), Johanna Drucker describes the \"unmarked text,\" which is \"the dominant model for works of literature...[and] scholarly prose\" (9', 'thes describes, and Phillips\\'s reading process enacts, an empowered reader who is not subordinate to the authority of the author and who breaks from the conformity of the \"unmarked text.\" In the wake of the authoritative author, Barthes inserts the \"[...] here and now\" (\"The Death\" 145). Rather than being the sole authority of the text, with conscious or unconscious intention that is the most appropriate source of meaning, the \"scriptor\" disappears upon the appearance of the text. The text presents itself as something not closed in on the author\\'s meaning, but waiting for the moment of reading to be performed actively. Furthermore, Barthes challenges the creative aspect of the author, claiming: [T]he writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original.

In many of Barthes's critical essays of the I96os, the effect of the compelling invitation to the reader to cease being a passive consumer and to become an active producer of signification cannot be underestimated. However, there is a real danger of making a fetish of such an idea to the extent that an enabling exhortation can become a reiterated commonplace. I fear that this dominant theoretical underpinning, encapsulated in Graniela- Rodriguez's advocacy of 'un mayor activismo por parte de quien lee' (p. v) or her repeated approval of a narrative discourse in which there is 'una progresiva desaparici6n \", 'use intertexts, s/he does do it unconsciously, since all language is essentially loaded with meanings from its use in countless other texts. Total originality is impossible precisely because all discourse is, what Derrida calls, \"bricolage\" and \"the [...]\"; consequently, Barthes states, \"the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original.\"\\'7 This form of intertextuality is inherent to all discourse and in many ways forms an important part of all communicative enterprises, particularly the literary. In fact, for Michael Riffaterre, intertextuality may lie at the very heart of the literary enterprise and be a defining characteristic of \"literariness\": \"literature is indeed made of texts. Literariness, therefore, must be sought at the level where texts combine, or signify by referring to other texts rather than to lesser sign systems.\"8 While all literature draws on this continually expanding intertextual web, the short story may be, as Clare Hanson persuasively argu', 'rre, Maurice Blanchot, e Paul de Man. Talvez o texto mais conhecido desta linha seja o ensaio \"The Death of the Author\" de Roland Barthes, que prop6e que \"a text unity lies not in its origin but in its destination\" (Barthes 148).7 Para Barthes, \"The [...] [...], he is simply that someone who holds together in a single field all the traces by which the written text is constituted\" (Barthes 148). A obra machadiana, neste sentido e certamente \"aberta.\" A valorizacao do papel do leitor fica evidente, por exemplo, em Dom Casmurro, onde o narrador comenta que \"ha livros que apenas terao isso [o titulo] dos seus autores; alguns nem tanto\" (809),8 claramente dando enfase maior ao processo de leitura do que a autoridade autoral. Mais explicitamente, na \"Advertencia\" de Papeis avulsos, ao discorrer sobre o genero dos seus escritos, Machado escreve, \"O livro esta nas maos do leitor\" (Papeis avulsos 252), entregando a este tambem a incumbencia de decidi-lo.

The idea that dance can be conceived of as an event, or object, that can be described, is challenged in the more extreme form of argument. Whether such a thing can exist other than as a \\'[...] of culture\\' is a matter of debate (Barthes in Lodge, 1988, p. 170). There is only space here for an assertion, following Hutcheon on history, that \\'past events are given meaning, not existence, by their representation\\' (1989, p. 82). Although the formalist position which ascribed autonomy to the work has long been shattered in the recognition of the ambiguity and the cultural position of art, the subtle play of texts is well encapsulated in Worton\\'s writing on intertextuality. He argues that it denies the authoritative validity of genetic readings which seek to fix the text, like a spiked butterfly which the entomologist will dissect scientifically.

Barthes is one of those theoreticians: \"the birth of the reader,\" as he puts it in the famous final sentence of his early essay, \"[...],\" implying by that a victory of writerliness over restrictive social ideologies. But as far as I can recall I\\'ve never referred to that essay \\n Reading, Mourning, and the Death of the Author 69 in my work, until now. It may perhaps have been something about that phrase \"at the cost of,\" which jibes a bit with the triumphalism of the sentence? For although Barthes is working here (the fact is often forgotten) within a certain theory of ?crit ure that has a long history in France, his phrase \"the death of the author,\" particularly when the word is shorn of its capital A, can itself readily be taken as a metaphor for the textual split that occurs when reading makes of a text, not an inert, parsable struc ture, but an interpretable utterance, ', 'rn systems of representation in art and science [which] have placed the act of looking at the centre of their enquiry\" and she reaffirmed the significance of Luce Irigaray\\'s writings on embodiment and touch. Critiquing Roland Barthes\\' concept of the [...],\" Betterton shifted attention to the body and to \"the physical acts of an embodied subject\" to reinscribe the body of the woman artist.79 One way of coming to terms with the corporeal and sensory disturbance encountered in installation art may be through the \"logic of the supplement\" proposed by Derrida. Alluding to the double meaning in French of supplément as addition and replacement, Derrida has indicated that the supplement is a movement which revokes binary opposition and that it is, as such, disruptive and even dangerous: \"Son glissement le dérobe à l\\'alternative simple de la presence et de l\\'absence. Tel est le danger.\"80 This dangerous supplement, he contends, \"entre par effraction dans cela même qui voudrait avoir pu s\\'en passer e', ' ideas about the importance, even relevance, in critical studies of such questions as artistic merit, artistic intentionality, and so on. Roland Barthes writes in his controversial poststructuralist essay, \\'The Death of the Author\" (1968), that \"the [...].\" Barthes suggests that the author is not an authority or ultimate source of meaning or interpretation but a kind of impersonal receptacle for language. The essay is more about ways of reading than anything else, but its de-emphasis of the author as a source of meaning might have some application to Swing Changes. When Stowe writes that \"historians must regard the score or recording as merely the sign of a large field of social forces that provide the ground for those texts,\" one wonders if he is heralding something like the death of the jazz musician. Any such suggestion is likely to send jazz fans hurrying back to stories of Bix\\'s love of drink, if not simply to drink. But, however we feel about Stowe\\'s critical assumptions, it would be ', 'rtist.12 The other of the more important essays espousing postmodern influence in its approach is David Headlam\\'s study of Led Zeppelin. The springboard for this essay is Barthes\\'s well-known quip, often taken as seminal for postmodernism, that \"the [...].\"13 Barthes\\'s remark has been elaborated by Foucault into a study of the attributes of authorship, including l?In her footnote 14, Hisama admits her inability to know what Crawford intended: \"I do not know whether Crawford intended the movement to enact the specific feminist strategy I am suggesting here.\" But she subsequently adds what strikes me as a hedge: \"Rather, my reading emerges from my knowledge of Crawford\\'s strong feelings about the inequity of women compared to men, and my identity as an Asian-American woman who occupies social spaces analogous to the two musical spaces I perceive in this piece\" (293). \"Mozart: a Life (New York: Harper-Collins, 1995), 351. 20Of course, if the artist is on record explaining the intended social m', 'al explica tion of the literary text, which perceives the author as the creator and origin of his work, a figure that exists outside of and anterior to his writing.

This critical position is what allows Jos? Cam?n Aznar to call El novelista an \"autoconfesi?n\" and to treat Andr?s Castilla, artist protagonist of the novel, and Ram?n as one and the same, using both names interchangeably in his textual commentary.12 The same interpretive assumptions underlie the following observation about the novel: \"[El novelista is], in some respects, an autobiographical novel. . ..

Most of this paradox is eliminated easily enough if we accept the argument that the records placing the book in the library i', 'he metaphorical death of the author appeals so strongly to Everett; he is profoundly opposed to limitations, finalities, and closures of meaning, particularly those that arise from an interpretive process in which the “explanation of a work is . . . [...]’ in us” (143). Everett does not “confide” in his reader or engage in overt didacticism because he ultimately believes that “the work is smarter than I am. Art is smarter than us . . . I have no desire to offer a political message in a novel. An artist cannot hide from her or his political beliefs; they will be in the work. But to presume that I am smart enough to preach a position runs counter to my artistic sense” (Goyal). Barthes crops up frequently in Everett’s fiction: he appears as “a commedia dell’arte caricature” (Berben-Masi, “Jailhouse” 54) of his real-life self in Glyph (1999), and a parody of his lengthy essay S/Z features prominently in Erasure; but perhaps the most telling use of his ideas appears in Percival Everett by Virgil', 'f the dictionary that defines me,” calling attention to how selves and texts must be understood as fictions that can never emerge in isolation and that will thus never be original or authentic. Indeed, Barthes asks readers to conceive any text as “a [...]” (1977, 46). Nevertheless, while in NW Smith presents numerous intertexts that “blend and clash” her narrative with and against others, there are references to her previous works and narratorial commentaries that, even if somewhat lost amongst many other voices, remind us of her authorial presence. There are two notable examples of this presence in the text. The first one is the reference to number 37. Some studies have attempted to decipher the meaning of this number in NW, which is randomly used as the title for certain sections in the 2 The phrase is also used as the title of two numbered sections in “Host” that narrate the transformation of Keisha into Natalie, through which the novel explores in more detail the possibilities and limit', 'nd its innovative lyricism.

Authors do not \"own\" texts but are themselves a function of the polyvalent and disseminative play of language. As Barthes has said, \"a [...] [because they are all metonymies], blend and clash\" (1977:146). The death of the author is a sign of the endless narrativity characteristic of language and of textual production. When the author \"dies,\" that is, when the author is no longer considered to be \"the subject with the book as predicate\" (Barthes 1977:145), then authority is located in the trajectories of desire that are unleashed by words and by texts. In the Gospel of Truth, the \"living book of the living\" is \"the one written in the thought and the mind [of the] Father\" (19.35-20.1); this book is a text viewed from the perspective of \"Father\" as that sign of the initiatory gap in language from which spring the movements of signification characteristic of language in its fullnes', 'hanged it, and thought to make a kind of play on whose work it is, whether mine or his\" (Johnson 1996, 205).7 This kind of play, which subverted the unity and isolation of the creative subject, was also carried out in texts of political theory. \"The [...] ... .\" (1977, 143). According to Barthes, the reader must \"kill\" the governing idea of the author to avoid constraining reading by making its conclusive reference the author. Twentieth-century American artists such as Jasper Johns also tried to free art from being an explanation of the artist, excluding their own desires and egos from their art in a variety of ways as an attempt to free art from the perceived dead end of their intention. Artists like Duchamp parodied the power of the author by signing discovered objects like mass produced urinals. To give another example, Zsolt Veress presented a project titled Common Name at the twentythird Sao Paulo Bienal held at the Center for Culture and Communication in Hungary detailing how he had e', 'ls Critifiction. The idea that runs throughout these essays is that literature does not express a préexistent meaning in the manner that both romanticism and realism tended to regard it but, as Roland Barthes has argued in \"The Death of the Author,\" [...] here and now. Meaning, if it existed at all, was to be found solely in the narrative act and conferred by the reader. Writers, artists, and musicians incorpo rated an awareness of the act of creation itself and so brought into their work a focus on performance which meant improvisation, a blurring of the distinction between artist and audience, a shift from esthetic distance to real time, and a displacement from what a work is to what it does. Surfiction, Federman argues, in a seminal essay which stands as a manifesto as well as a description, neither represents the world nor ex presses the inner self. It searches \"within the fiction for the implications of what it means to write fiction.\" In place of characters whose psychol ogy explains ', \"ions' whose multiplicity of blending and clashing significances are to be disentangled only by the reader-figure who has now displaced the author as the focus of attention. 'The birth of the reader', as Barthes pronounced somewhat melodramatically, '[...].'1 The spread of this new gospel was undoubtedly facilitated by the more or less independent growth in the 1970s of differing versions of reception theory. These gave the authority now taken away from the author at first to historically-located individuals or groups, then to the individual consciousness of different readers at different times, or later still to the relative consensus attained by a specific 'interpretive community'.2 Such theorists have had their use in recalling to the forefront of attention the undoubted truth that a literary work is only 'there' insofar as the words on the pages are being responded to by the reader, but their one-sided emphases have understandably disquieted those of us who continue to believe that some \", 'to decipher. Rather, Barthes invites us to imagine the text anew, not as a line with one single meaning but rather as a “multi-dimensional space” where the “quotations” of culture “blend and clash.” In manifesto-like language, Barthes proclaims: “We [...]’ meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-God) but a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture” (146). Barthes shifts power away from the Author (whom he indicates has occupied a nearly God-like place of authority in literary criticism) and hails the reader whose role it is to untangle the network of meanings a text opens up. The task then of what he calls the “modern scriptor” is not so much to express feelings as it is to mix writing, to copy or translate. Barthes’ image of the text as “multi-dimensional” space, when applied to “Good Country People,” frees us to hear how clichés circulate throughout the story', 'epetition happens to us), as Freud has it, but we experience it through reading. This uncanny experience is a reading experience, an experience of déjà lu. As such it is housed in the readers\\' subjectivity, \"the space,\" in Barthes\\'s words, \"on which [...]\" (1977: 148). The coincidence, within that space, of the recognition of a particular hypotext and an awareness of the textual compulsion to repeat it, elicits an eerie interruption. The compulsion to return to the earlier novel may be seen as an effect of the anxiety of influence, a batdeground for asserting will and originality against the oppressive force of Conrad\\'s detested precursor. The novel, moreover, offers a performative re-enactment of this rivalry in the staging of a similar interruption of the life of its protagonist. Haldin\\'s invasion of Razumov\\'s life recasts this batde in the diegesis. Such mirroring may be used in formulating a viable interpretation of the text: Under Western Eyes may be viewed as a programmatic transposit', ' typical features of the Rushdie brand of writing. Obviously, the most appropriate critical approach to his works would be one that avoids intentional fallacy and positions itself within the poststructuralist postulate of the death of the author. If [...]\", as Barthes contended (1977: 147), Rushdies hypertextual fiction, that challenges the familiar mechanisms of smooth reading, stands to gain from not being encumbered by the ostensible weight of authorship. When Rushdie, who is himself a fiercely independent literary critic, and who refutes the psychological orientation of reality (1988: 432), publishes a memoir which retraces his life and works, his readers might wonder what this exercise in life writing means. Indeed the projected novelization of Rushdie s life by Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Rushdie 201 2: 408) might have been a determining factor in his decision to write his life so as to assert his control over it. Besides, his third wife was very unwilling to return some personal photos t', 'ary in which letters and phrases, organized in alphabetical sequence, evaporate, morph into new shapes, shimmer and disappear. In such a work, \"spatial form\" becomes \"virtual space.\" In chronicling \"the death of the author,\" Roland Barthes noted: \"a [...] . . . but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture\" (146). Although conceptualists and New Media poets have not drawn extensively on Barthes\\'s work, these remarks from the mid-1970s seem prophetic of many issues in their poetics. Digital technologies make collaboration an essential feature of \\n 614 ♦ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE the new poetics, whether through jointly produced installations like those of Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries and Buffalo\\'s Critical Art Ensemble, or through the almost inevitable collaboration between Web designers, poets, and visual media specialists.

In literature Barthes suggests: “The [...]”;1 at the same time, “to give writing its future, it is necessary to overthrow the myth: the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author.”2 Whether Barthes is correct or not regarding the reader (or listener), in music there is the additional element of the performer to contend with. Does the rising control of the performer and recordist over so many compositional elements herald the “death” of the iconic composer before the music even reaches its audience? Notions about where authorship ends and craftsmanship begins are further complicated by the nature of improvisation, and are all the more in question as composition and improvisation increasingly interact with the recording process. Issues surrounding musical form', 'semantic world made up of the interrelations and collisions of stories, as stories about dignified Christian girls in Samoa collide with stories about night dances. One might wonder if \\'Aute, like the reader in Barthes\\'s The Death of the Author, is \"[...] by which ... [culture] is constituted\" (1977:148). Yet \\'Aute\\'s exteriorized intrapersonal drama rewrites these traces. Sauma\\' iafe does not general ly play so supportive a role in possession. Here Sauma\\'iafe is \\'Aute\\'s own mosaic: Sauma\\'iafe represents an attempt to make inherently conflictual cultural stories cohere in one persona, a persona to which \\'Aute aspires. In possession there is no need to proclaim the \"death of the author,\" for this dispatch is constitutive to possession narratives: their human author is putatively absent. And yet, just as our obsession with the individual author and the obsession with the individual subject implied by it is, as Barthes rightly observes, distortive to an understanding of narratives, the vanishin', \" American ideology from the beginning, does allow of compromise, but in literary terms it creates a contestable gap or a space to be exploited those with differing views. As Roland Barthes comments: Thus literature (it would be better, henceforth to [...] to the text (and to the world as text) a 'secret: ' that is, an ultimate meaning, liberates an activity which we might call counter-theological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to arrest meaning is finally to refuse God and his hy postases, reason, science, the law.5 In the institution of slavery, nineteenth century American ideology, and hence its writers, faced a legal, moral and real impasse difficult to reconcile. For those determined on change, the abolitionists and the slaves themselves, the exploitation of contestable space in American ideology became their modus operandi. William Lloyd Garrison, for instance, harboured no doubts regarding the difference between the law and its spirit. The very first issue of The Liberator con\", 'oundbreaking essay of 1968, “The Death of the Author”, Roland Barthes points to the impossibility to identify and define the voice of the speaker that emanates from a given literary text, since “Writing is \\n What Is Israeli In Israeli Art? • 175 the [...]”.8 According to Barthes, such impossibility pertains to every act of writing since the very beginning of culture. However, at a certain historical moment the author, as we know him today, was born. From that moment, the status of the author as genius, the one in whose proper name the text is disseminated, has been placed on a pedestal, and the work of art, in all its genres, has been conceived of as a product of the author’s specific life.9 This conception is undermined by the Modernist position, which Barthes locates, for instance, in Mallarmé’s writing, in which, he claims, “It is language which speaks, not the author”,10 or in Surrealism with its invention of practices such as automatic writing or collaborative writing, practices in wh', 'e away from their transcription work. The \"modern scriptor,\" Barthes\\'s proposed replace ment for the seemingly dead Author, no longer records any personal genius, but channels the textual world around itself, existing only as an act of language: The [...], that his hand is too slow for his thought or passion and that consequently, making a law of necessity, he must emphasize this delay and indefinitely \\'polish\\' his form. For him, on the contrary, the hand, cut off from any voice, borne by a pure gesture of inscription (and not of expression), traces a field of origin - or which, at least, has no other origin than language itself, language which ceaselessly calls into question all origins. (Barthes 1977, 145) Such a figure finds a close fellow in Text 5\\'s anonymous and inscrutable \"clerk,\" \"the scribe,\" \"not understanding what I hear, not knowing what I write\" (Beckett, 311): at the hearings of what cause I know not.

Writing, according to Barthes, is “that [...].”143 This is exactly what happens in the mirror and to the Lacanian subject. In this meaning text, like the mirror, can reveal and simultaneously deceive. Furthermore, the different temporality discussed byBarthes has not escaped the perspicacious observance of the Persian Sufi thinker, Hamadānī (discussed succinctly above) in his analogy. Barthes argues: The temporality is different. The Author, when believed in, is always conceived of as the past of his own book: book and author stand automatically on a single line divided into a before and an after. The author is thought to nourish the book, which is to say that he exists before it, thinks, suffers, lives for it, is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his ch', 'he sovereign and generating author\" (Spivak lxxiv), then by presenting himself as a plural author Fowles has made the reader more thoroughly the producer of the text than his strident tone suggests he intended. It is Roland Barthes who writes, \\'\"The [...]\" (Barthes 148)-but the reader of The French Lieutenant\\'s Woman is never sure if Fowles really means to die. His use of epigraphs is an extension of the traditional Victorian model which gives more power to the author rather than calling him into question, but the effect of the epigraphs within the playful context Fowles creates is a transgressive one. Without the epigraphs, he would have been more likely to produce a book; as it is, he has generated what Derrida terms \"the disruption of writing\" (Of Grammatology 18). Attention to the epigraphic paratext does indeed suggest that it controls the whole reading: the servant turns out to be the master. But there is another way to read.

This kind of textual mélange permeates the pages of Celestina in such a way that «su principal ystoria o ficción toda junta» blends with the «delectables fontezicas de filosophía» that emerge from a wide range of textual and oral sources. The study of the literary influences and sources of Rojas’ work has proven to be a fertile field that has kept researchers active for decades. Indeed as time has gone by, Celestina continues to engage scholars by means of the diverse range of literary a', ', without a national structure of permanent exhibition ... dependent on stalwart individuals.\"8 This reification of the artist obeys the modernist logic of authorship Roland Barthes lays to rest, arguing that the author is a convenient fiction which [...][es] it with a final signified.\"9 Because avant-garde exhibition has been \"clearly framed by presence and anecdote,\" Patricia Mellencamp cautions, the \"personal appearance system ... risk[s] placing \\'meaning\\' totally within the author.\"\\'1 Along similar lines, but placing less emphasis on the cult of the individual, Jim Peterson argues that avant-garde film viewers depend upon filmmakers\\' appearances at screenings because they provide explanations to an audience engaging in \"problem solving\" at cognitive and thematic levels.1 Avant-garde film spectators, then, may expect that film viewing in itself will constitute an event, framed as it often is by the live appearance of the filmmaker.12 Thus, the distinction between filmgoing as event and o', 'tion ists banish the author as \"a figment of humanist ideology\" (245).4 Roland Barthes, for example, holds that we can no longer believe in an \"Author God\" who creates a meaning that can be discerned: \"Once the Author is removed,\" Barthes says, \"the [...].\"5 With the structuralists and decon structionists, Christopher Norris argues, the reader is \"left floating in an in finite freeplay of signs\"; there is no \"privileged object\" that is \"a bearer of \\'meanings\\' \" to be figured out in \"subservient fashion\" (249).6 Thus inter preters are left, David H.

He argues that by falling back upon the concept of an idealized, corporeal, and totalizable author, we lose the ability to appreciate how texts function. Barthes is laying the foundation of an argument that he would develop over the course of his career: the movement away from autonomous literary work to contingent cultural text. Replacing the author, he posits a modern scriptor that would emerge “simultaneously with the text,” never “preceding or exceeding the writing” (146). Barthes makes the case that any analysis of iteration and representation must consider the social, interactive, and communicative function of language, and not just the biography, psychology, and intentionality of the author (or, parallel with the “author,” a', ', interactive, and communicative function of language, and not just the biography, psychology, and intentionality of the author (or, parallel with the “author,” an idealized “work” of the sort posited by some formalists, such as the New Critics). He [...]” (148). In order to recognize Barthes’s insight, it is important to note the intellectual relevance of authorship to virtually every facet of humanistic scholarly inquiry. During the modern era, the humanistic traditions of literature, philosophy, and history all developed in conjunction with, and were reinforced by, the concept of individualized authorship. Thus, Barthes was responding to both academic and popular representations of authorship with his polemical essay, concluding with his now famous dictum, “The birth of the Reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author” (148). The following year, Foucault responded to Barthes with “What Is an Author?” which develops the concept of the author-function.4 The notion of the corporeal', \" the centrifugal force of signification. The author's status, too, is ontologically insecure. Authorial intrusion calls ironical attention to the author's absence and what Roland Barthes calls the death of the author. Writing, says Barthes, ťis that [...] . . .' (in McHale 1987:200). The aesthetic shift is from art as creative self-realization to art as discursive self-dissolution. But this is complicated by the fact that the dead author's intrusive absence is a simultaneous presence. McHale notes that the author is an 'ontologically amphibious figure', alternately present and absent, flickering in and out of existence. The fate of the author in postmodernism thus echoes the fate of the ontologically insecure self in postmodernity, exemplified by the phenomenon of borderline psychopathology. The borderline self, like the postmodernist author, feeling neither alive or dead, flickers in and out of existence, dispersed within a decentred narrative beyond authorial control or comprehension.

From the discussion above, we already know how the work was read by Tarnawski: for him, the convention of Polish Romanticism was crucial. It was within this frame that he located his translation. A similar \"testimony of reading\" has been given by the eminent Polish critic Kazimierz Wyka (1910-1975), who follows Tarnawski\\'s assumptions: \"The translator, who claimed that while working', 'r kind of critic] doesn’t care about the distinction between discovery and creation [...] 58 For Roland Barthes, the critical search for “truth” is quite useless, as there is no “truth”, nor even any operant factor in a text, except language itself: [...].

In “The Death of the Author,” Roland Barthes says, “[T][...]”(1988, 170). An act of writing is a dance of sources, or appropriated language and concepts, expressing themselves in their combinations and conflicts. And the reader, as Barthes says, “ought at least to know that the inner thing he thinks to translate is itself only a ready-formed dictionary” (170). Thus conceived, the author has multiple selves. He is a unique confluence of other voices, none his own. “It is the language which speaks, not the author” (168). The writer does not invent; he can, as Barthes states, “only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original” (170). Foucault also asserted what he called the “plurality of self” that an author contains, or which contains him or her (1988, 205). When one refers to an author,', \"He also literalises the idea of the death of the author, as theorised by Foucault himself and, before him, Roland Barthes. '[W]riting is the destruction of every voice', Barthes states, 'of every point of origin.' He goes on to describe a text as a '[...] and clash'.72 And Foucault, referring to writing as 'its author's murderer', claims that the author 'must assume the role of the dead man in the game of writing'.73 With these words in mind, it is hard not to think of Sir Henry Wallis' s serene image of the death scene (George Meredith's trailing arm, purple trousers, pre-Raphaelite locks) and of Ackroyd's fine novelistic parody: ... his left arm is pressed against his chest while his right arm slips from the bed, the hand clenching and unclenching as if trying to grasp the torn scraps of his writing which are scattered across the floor.

Barthes envisions, in place of the Au thor, a modern scriptor, whose \"[...] a field with out origin—or which, at least, has no other origin than language itself, language which ceaselessly calls into question all origins\" (146). Such an axiom, however, poses irreconcilable problems for the critic who reads Milton\\'s God in Barth esian terms. If language itself stands in place of God, we are left with a neutral system of langue that is nothing more than a medium without the intentions of parole. If this were the case, the self interested interpretations of God\\'s language per formed by the \"grievous Wolves\" (12.508) must also be accepted as valid since language \"cease lessly calls into question all origins\" and there fore can have no overseeing Will.

However, the \"grievous Wolves\" of Book 12 are metaphorically allied with and undercut by Satan, the \"prowling Wolf\\' (4.183) in Eden, who, as Nyquist suggests, may be the archetypal subversive reader. Con trary to', 'ncompati bility of Barthes\\'s Author and Milton\\'s God might suggest ways in which the question should be reversed. Specifically, how do reading strate gies in Paradise Lost point to weaknesses in Barthes\\'s essay? Barthes indignantly declares that \"to [...]\" (147). But do the Satanic read ings not suggest the importance of limits? If Barthes is concerned that \"final signified[s]\" and \"close[d] writing\" sound disturbingly formalist in their rigid organic unity, a comparison with Mil ton\\'s God shows ways in which Barthes\\'s theory collapses into the problems of the very formalism it abhors. Because of his involvement of free willed readers, Milton\\'s God maintains some de gree of formalist control, in that he and his read ers ultimately seek to refine one final meaning where God \"shall be All in All,\" but the process depends on the reader to say what God himself has not said, to enter into the authority of a con tinuing creation. Only at that point will interpre tation become obsolete. Barthes\\'s ', \"a literary ordering of a tale's earlier contexts or unfamiliar spaces' (59) and to argue that we could read other romances the same way if we were only aware of their sources, however, seems rather obvious; as Barthes insisted as long ago as 1972, a [...] ... a text's unity lies not in its origin but in its destination' (Roland Barthes, 'The Death of the Author' in Image / Music / Text, trans.

Never, however is the centrality of memory to romance in particular addressed directly. McKinstry insists that 'the present and the future is [sic] shaped ... by the past in romance' (161) without ever considering that th\", 's I loved at the Nuart were all made by artists; it was a time when Three decades ago Roland Barthes elegantly defined cultural text as “a tissue of quotafilm was an art form.

With Albahari, as I discussed in chapter 3, his poetic voice was invested in writing as a matter of enunciation in the manner described by Roland Barthes in “The Death of the Author”: [...] “hold together,” suffices, that is to say, to exhaust it.12 The premise here is that the “I” is characterless and identity-less and should not consequently be typified by vocabulary that appeals to creation and origins. This chimes with Albahari’s frequent statements that language – and the form that is carved out of it – escapes from the author, that the utterance possesses an internal self-renewing principle of creation.13 It is easy to understand how this argument would have been an oblique rejection of the functionalized figure of an author in a socialist environment. It is this particular theoretical conceit of authorship that is problematized by the events of the 1990s, which, by provoking individual commentary on social affairs, dem', 'according to Derrida, requires \"a transformation or general deformation of logic\" (\"Choreographies\" 72).

In postmodernism, the author has either been effaced from the text (Barthes), has given up his or her proper name as a commodity or metaphor (Derrida), or has been dispersed into innumerable demand-driven functions (Foucault). Pierre Bourdieu has suggested that the modern author is a product of belief in the cultural field of art and literature; he or she is an author inasmuch as consumers believe in his or her status as a', 't\\'s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination\" (my italics).

The reader is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed without any of them being lost; a text\\'s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination. Yet this destination cannot any longer be personal: the reader is with out history, biography, psychology; he is simply that someone who holds together in a single field all the traces by which the written text is constituted.

The \" unity\" of the destination, the reading or reader, then is a unity of \" a single field,\" a non-personal \" space \" in which all the contradictions are \" inscribed \" or \" contained.\" Ambiguously, the seeds of the dispersal of that unity are either already suggested or the unity itself is already illusory. But Barthes\\' whole career is exemplary in this regard. In 1970, Barthes published S/Z, a book cited constantly, particularly by the essayists in the Suleiman-Crosman volume. Usu ally offered as an example of Barthes\\' structuralism, S/Z is also per haps one of the most thorough phenomenological descriptions of the different activities that constitute any act of', 'tive of authorship in ways important to a study of anonymity.

Stephen Heath (New York: Hill and Wang, 1977), 142. Michel Foucault offered a reconsideration and development of Barthes\\' theory by pointing out that, despite the death of the author which Barthes described as integral to the modern act of writing, critics remain dependent on the idea of an \"author\" as a function of discourse, a boundary, a means of categorization; see \"What is an Author?\" in Language, Counter- Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews, trans.

This approach to criticism might seem paradoxical since the professional development of the author, rather than literary criticism, was the purpose of the investigation. It was clear from this enquiry, however, that it was more productive to direct the criticism at the text rather than directly at the author. This led to insights which I was then able to take outside the writing and relate to my day to day professional practice.

No longer can we confidently speak of authors as locatable subjects-they have been lost in the discontinuous structures of the text. And if there are no more authors, neither are there any more \"works\" in the sense of substantial objects to which we can point. The \"work\" has become a \"text\": \"the work is a fragment of substance, occupying a part of the space of books (in a library for example), the Text is a methodological field\" (pp. 156-57).

In 1969 Foucault is less extreme than Barthes or Derrida in the sense that he believes \"it would be pure romanticism . .. to imagine a culture in which the fictive would operate in an absolutely free state, in which fiction would be put at the disposal of everyone and would develop without passing through something like a necessary or constraining figure\" (\"WIA,\" p. 119). Thus he does not at that time propose that texts be construed as fields of discourse without any boundaries (authorial or otherwise) to limit the free play of the signifier, as Barthes and Derrida do. Instead, he diverts our attention from the intentions of the text to \"the modes of circulation, valorization, attribution, ', 'm\\'s position on the death of the author given in Barthes and Foucault, we might usefully ask: what precisely was killed off in the late 1960s when the death of the author was first articulated by French theorists?

Soon he is referring to a creature called \"the scrip tor\" who succeeds the author and who has neither \"passions, humors, feelings, impressions,\" but rather an \"immense dictionary from which he draws a writing that can know no halt; life never does more than imitate the book, and the book itself is only a tissue of signs....\" In other words, il n\\'y a pas de hors-texte. It would be nice, of course, to think that, if there is indeed nothing outside the text, then at least we are free to write the text ourselves.

Barthess concept of the text appears first of all as an extension of his concept of writing. We would need to go back to Writing Degree Zero, his true point of departure in 1953, to grasp this genealogy and to understand what writing means.

T\", \"the tone for much of Rushdie's fiction: Once the Author is removed, the claim to decipher a text becomes quite futile . To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing ... In the [...] posits meaning to evaporate it, carrying out a systematic exemption of meaning, in precisely this way literature (it would be better from now on to say writing) by refusing to assign a 'secret', an ultimate meaning, to the text (and to the world as text), liberates what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity that is truly revolutionary since to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases - reason, science, law. There are two important founding ideas of structuralist (and therefore poststructuralist) thought in this passage. One, the attack on myths of origin. And two, the spatialising of the linear. Barthes, of course, is talking about texts, primarily; but theology is not just a metaphor here, a\", ' as merely a supportive, albeit necessary, part of the process that produces a text’s meaning.50 His approach is far more radical. By transforming the usually singular word “meaning” into a strange plural, he dismisses the entire traditional model. “[...].”51 The assumption that in Barthes’ theory the text “is no longer seen as a prefabricated product with a fixed, indeed still hidden yet definite and forever inscribed meaning, but rather as an open texture, whose meaning is always updated by the reader,”52 is, to say the least, capable of being misunderstood. In this formulation, Barthes’ model seems to still cling to the traditional concept of meaning, whereas the abandonment of this concept is precisely the aim, as well as the consequence, of Barthes’ model. Therefore, Barthes cannot be cited in support of either side in the classic hermeneutic debate about whether a more subjective or a more objective method of interpretation is desirable. He rejects the role of hermeneutics altogether.', 'dering the king is a process of secularization, not only as an alienating adoption of, but also as a fundamental abandonment of the theological concept. This, at least, is the horizon of Barthes’ analysis of the death of the author: [L]iterature (it [...].68 379 LAL2203_01.indd 379 10/21/10 11:13:29 AM \\n Law & L i tera ture • Vo lume 22, Number 3 Democracy, then, is not merely the replacement of the old sovereign with a new governing subject, “demos,” constituted by way of contrafactual assumptions. Rather, democracy takes shape as a political system in which governance is always fractured and the status of subjectivity always newly disseminated. The democratic process would then designate a movement of constant repetition—a movement, however, that not only reproduces itself in a tautological sense, but that, by reiterating itself within its own structures, allows for the emergence of something new. “Reading” is just another word for this process. I V . According to literary critic Aleida A', 'image of the poem with a misogynistic and patri archal author-function while Webber surrounds hers with a revolutionary author-function—only proves Barthes\\'s and Foucault\\'s tandem idea con cerning the nature of writing. That is, as Barthes puts it, \"[...]\" (142; see also Foucault 142). This does not imply that readers do not imagine a \"body writing.\" Indeed we do, but we forget that our image of the body writing is an image, a figuration that may or may not correspond to the actual body that has writ ten. We forget that we generate our image of the author from the \"neutral, composite, oblique space\" of the text where there is no body at all. Out of the oblique space of the text, we generate author-functions that assist in the transformation of text into a work. The kind of author-function we use in understanding a text as a work deter mines the readings it is possible for us to have of the work. Gilbert\\'s author-function for Paradise Lost determines her reading of the epic in one way, and W', 'er are irrelevant. And this presupposition underwrites the notion that the particularities of any given knower are irrelevant to the report of knowledge, which licenses the eclipse of the producer of that report, the writer. Roland Barthes describes [...]\" (1977, 142). Barthes\\'s characterization is afortiori appropriate to Science writing, which relies on a number of linguistic protocols to accomplish the desired depersonalization. These include: 1. Salient use of the passive voice, in particular the so-called agentlessor what Halliday and Martin (1993, 58) refer to as the \"suppressedperson\"- passive, favored by the editors of many Science journals: 20 ml of sulfuric acid was added to the solution; previously (Upjohn 1977b) it was pointed out that... ; not only has female personal experience tended to be excluded from the discourse of knowledge, but the realm of the personal itself has been coded asfemale and devalued for that reason.7 6 This line of reasoning and its entailments regarding ', 'remarks, we find words to write only after what they would tell is already dead in our hearts. Or, as Wood comments, \"To write is not to be absent but to become absent; to be someone and then go away, leaving traces. \\'Writing,\\' Barthes says, \\'is the [...] origin.\\' Well, writing is stealthier than this,- it doesn\\'t destroy, even at its most dramatic, it only discreetly ruins our various dreams of immediacy, converts them to fragments, vestiges, questions.

Voices, unattached now to persons, said that', 'he act of prophesying, who acts as the “instrumental agent” to serve God, the “principle agent.”27 Barthes merely replaces the role of God with that of language, while equating the role of the author with that of “the modern scriptor,” for whom, the [...]. 28 In short, the dichotomous author (i.e., dividing the author’s role between God and a prophet, or similarly, into the role of language and that of “the modern scriptor”), is anticipated in the classical and medieval traditions. This is attested by the notion that inspiration for poetry catches the poet but is inaccessible to him; this can also be seen in the Biblical exegetical tradition that traces authorship to the Holy Spirit. Logically, the difference between the radical modern depersonalization of the author and the classical and medieval theories is none other than the former’s || 25 Bloom 1975: 62. 26 Barthes 2002: 4. 27 Based on the words of Nicholas of Lyra (c. 1270–1340) quoted by Minnis.

In contrast to these positions, Griswold (1993:465) argues that readers may exhibit considerable freedom in their interpretation of texts, beyond the intentions of authors, without entirely erasing the work of authors or their ability to convey intended meanings in the texts they create: Sociologists should rediscover that forgotten soul, the author, who has been deconstructed \\n 50 American Sociological Review 77(1) into oblivion. It may seem a sign of theoreti', ' other textsin the widest sense; past and futureplay a part. This also fuels a redefinition of the traditional roles of authors and readers. In his article, \"The Death of the Author,\"13 Barthes writes that (w)e know now that a text consists not of a [...]\" meaning (the \"message\" of the Author-God), but of a multidimensional space in which are married and contested several writings, none of which is original: the text is a fabric of quotations, resulting from a thousand sources of culture.14 When the autonomy of the text is weakened, the author\\'s authority is reduced. At the same time the reader becomes more productive in relation to the text. Barthes, then, sees the reader rather than the author as bringing together the diversity of the text. What the poststructuralists around Tel Quel really did was to create a philosophical foundation for shifting the interest in literary studies and text theory from an attempt to expose the inherent meaning of a text to exploring its relationship with ot', 'modernist works I have mentioned originated. Like the magazine (which, in the original eighteenth-century sense of the term, designated a multiauthored miscellany), the high modernist text presents itself, in Roland Barthes\\'s well-worn phrase, as \"a [...] . . blend and clash.

Toklas’s, or “Everybody” else’s identities—the meaning of writing does not occur, as formerly thought, within the mind of the author but, instead, within the mind of the reader: “[T]he reader is the very space in which [...], all the citations out of which a writing is made; the unity of a text is not in its origin but in its destination” (54). Thus, in modern and postmodern theories of authorship, the author/autobiographer has little to no “control” over the meaning of her work. The text itself is always unstable and cannot be fixed to a single meaning that would reflect an author’s “true” intent, no matter how much an author or autobiographer would wish it to be so. Obviously, authors and theorists such as Barthes and Stein experiment with and challenge the boundaries and the “author-ity” of written texts. They play with and delight in the slippage, tensions, contradictions, and deconstruction always occurring, despite many authors’ attempts to fix their lif', ' ...\" [45]), Everett doesn\\'t allow that reflexivity to puncture a hole in the center of his text.

He uses this poststructural premise to obviate the separation and difference that the sense/reference dis tinction institutes. Once the poststructural premise of the novel col lapses sense and reference, Everett becomes free to produce a world in which he and his father are one: \"Your old man posing as you in a voice that is at once yours and at once mine and at once neither\" (29). Here the radical indeterminacy of the narrative voice allows each to occupy the position of narrator, thereby allowing each to become the other as well. Like \"two keys hopefully capable of opening the same lock,\" the novel writes the father and son increasingl', ' the relativist text allows no final determination of meaning.

The text\\'s surface will therefore appear flat in the same way that a modern painting without fixed perspective appears flat, and for the same reason.

Something offered so as to secure something other. The author must be sacrifi ced for the reader. It is not therefore sacred. What begins to crown here is not simply the reader, but reading. It is not therefore uninteresting that precisely in his function as an educator Barthes, in 1972, addressed a group of lycée teachers on the topic of what he titled, “For a Theory of Reading.” Such talks were designed to bring hi', \"talk about his private life.

He warns against the pigeon-holing of complex texts in a context where their 'meaning' is firmly inscribed in the life of the author. There is a tendency in Brisset's analysis of Kennedy's poems to do precisely this, especially in the chapters where she dissects the public and private aspects of his life, using the twin guises of'the scapegoat' and 'the mask', words which appear in the titles of four of the nine chapters. Barthes proceeds to argue that a text can only be 'disentangled, not deciphered' (p. 147). In her chapter entitled 'Scapegoat', Brisset is unrelenting in her effort to condate the poet with his poems, to the extent o\", 'ace in a given situation.\" 138 When an utterance in a text is seen as \"bodily behavior,\" he observes, it \"takes on aspects of bodily movement: the gestural text, the accompanying intonation, obey them.\" 139 Echoing Roland Barthes\\' famous claim that \"[...],\" Sakai adds that the performative situation establishes the text as a historical entity and shapes the meaning of its utterances.140 The parallels between Jinsai\\'s new discourse and the new parodist literature are unmistakable. Sakai observes that the centrality of the performative situation replicates Jinsai\\'s affirmation of the body. Similarly, the \"dialectic of life and death\" that he finds in the new plays and poetry is reminiscent of the interplay of direct and indirect speech in Jinsai\\'s writings.141 If \"death\" can be construed as a move toward indirect speech and the \"enunciated,\" Sakai reasons, the new parodist literature, like Jinsai\\'s ethics, cannot countenance death.\\'42 In a brilliant move that invokes but also recasts Harootun', 'f meaning in a text, which previous critical methods have assumed, has necessarily been disputed.

The postmodern solution to this author-itarianism is the death of the author, thus the elimination of authorial control over the making of meaning. Increasingly, this postmodern critique has taken the form of emphasizing the role of the reader to compensate for or to hasten the reduction or elimination of the author. Theresa Enos notes that \"more and more we\\'re hearing another slogan: The tyranny of the author has been replaced by that of the reader\" (339).

Like Barthes, Lefebvre defines the social text by whether it is more or less legible. He distinguishes a scale of legibility from the excessively rich text, overloaded with symbolism or information, to the trivial text, tediously repetitive and reduced to banal signals. Somewhere between them lies the good social text, informative and even surprising, but not exceeding the capability of the subject to read it. He also recognizes that readers differ, from the ignorant to the informed. To exemplify the social text, Lefebvre evokes contrasting encounters with the village and the town. Whereas the village is a simple and archaic environment, dominated by symbols, the town is a complex modern experience, traversed', 'o close the writing’.1 Furthermore, this shift in understanding the relationship between author and text fundamentally alters the temporality of authorship itself. In the more traditional understanding of the author, Barthes explains, the author ‘is [...]’. By contrast, the modern author (whom Barthes refers to as a ‘scriptor’) ‘is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written here and now’.2 For Barthes, the past-ness of the traditional author and the implicit causality of the author–text relationship pose untenable limits on interpretation. Instead, by shifting focus to the reader, Barthes sought to disburden the text from the oppressive force of intention. Foucault would similarly contend in his essay ‘What Is an Author?’ that it is readers who construct authors: the author, he writes, ‘does not ', '123- 64, Fall 1974-Winter 1975.

The song can hardly be understood by merely studying its sheet music and its author\\'s original concept and context. Yet recovering the song\\'s origins is an invaluable way to highlight its unlikely destinations. The seemingly infinite possibilities for studying the destinations of music have become possible only in the past century, when sound recording and film have allowed performance to be textualized for study in a way that was previously available only through manuscripts and publications. Scholars of American music have risen to the occasion and found American popular music a particularly rich domain for studying performances and their meanings, leading to Richard \\n Irving Be', 'ts at least a momentary consideration.

This was especially true in those cases where the author happened to be dead! While for Richard Rorty, in his advocacy of \"strong misreading,\" it is legitimate for readers to beat the text into whatever shape serves their momentary purpose, Father Potter advocated imaginatively re-enacting the enduring purposes embodied in a particular text. He saw the advocacy of strong misreading as a license for textual violence (though the advocates themselves would readily admit this, countering the criticism by charging that it makes a fetish of the text). Fidelity to the text is possible only through imaginative participation in the embodied purposes ', ' conception.1 In his essay, Barthes gives primacy to the reader over the author, arguing that the author always occupies, on some level, the position of the dead, having disappeared, by necessity, after the very moment of utterance.

Barthes\\' provocative concept, the claim that \"the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author\" (148), takes on new meaning when we consider the actual death of the author and the existence of the unfinished, unpublished text.

The dismantling of authorial identity and sanctity, depicted movingly in \"The Circular Ruins\" or with jolting clarity in \"Everything and Nothing\" (here Shakespeare and God, alike, discover they are \"muchos y nadie,\" El hacedor, 45) is incessantly thematized in Borges\\'s fictions. In a true postmodern sense, the text is not just symbolic formation but rather an inexhaustible zone of generation and, in the words of Leon Bloy - cited by Borges - \"ese libro incesante es la tinica cosa que hay en el mundo; es, mejor dicho, el mundo\" (Harss 160). Borges\\'s own variant on this proposition is that \"la historia universal es un infinito libro sagrado que todos los hombres escriben y leen y tratan de entender, y en el que tambid', 'hand and preserves the dense unity of a single, singular work. Texts are interchangeable, differential but undifferentiated. Everything signifies ceaselessly, without being delegated to an ultimate structure.

In Riera\\'s story, access to this web site will allow each user to create a \"cuento original a base del sabio manejo de la intertextualidad y del intratexto, el mejor cuento posible entre los cuentos ya contados o por contar\" (150). The doctrine of the \"death of the author,\" with its literary roots in Borges\\'s fictions, finds its thundering echo here, and the greater the interweaving of off-stage voices and the more indeterminate the origin of the statements, the more plural the text becomes.

I can see his blood on the road, but I cannot do anything\" (128). Sometimes tenses switch in mid-sentence: \"It was a horrible place, I\\'m not used to such houses\" (78). The lack of quotation marks throughout the narrative places a great responsibility upon the reader to make rapid adjustments in identity and time. Quotation marks testify to an ideology of language as individual property. As textual markers they enclose and fence certain arrangements of words as the property of a single speaker. Language enters the provenance of possessive individualism and distinct identity.

Contrary to Kittler and Barthes, however, most critics still focus on the fundamental ‘‘Epochenverwandtschaft’’ (WalterMüller-Seidel) between the two time periods.1 They identify the birth of the modern episteme, to use Foucault’s terminology, with the rise of Romanticism and thus tend to emphasize its similarities rather than its differences with literary modernism around 1900.

In contrast, Kitaj as an artist-reader, and Kitaj' s art, and Kitaj' s own commentaries, are concerned not merely with the content of a book, but with the look of it, the smell of it (one of the crucial differences between new and second-hand), with where it is read, and when, and how often and how quickly, whether alone or in public, at home or in foreign places, and with who lent or recommended it - with all the intricacies, minutiae and subtle sense impressions involved in the act of reading, only consciously noticed, perhaps, if we switch from one edition of a book to another in the course of reading it, or read while travelling, when everything is noticeable. Kitaj often speaks of such details when discussing the books his pictures \", 'y unrealistic notions about the nature of this sphere, which the sociology of art has shown to be unacceptable. In 1977, Barthes, referring to writers, snapped the petrified view of the artist as bearer of meaning. An image is not a bundle of shapes [...] - the message of the Artist-God - but a multidimensional space in which a variety of shapes, none of them original, blend and clash. The image is a conglomorate of quotations cobbled together from countless corners of culture.

Consequently, the authenticity of the autobiographic account is completely destabilized. Up until this point, Galatea 2.2 appears to be yet another theoretically well-informed and meta-fictionally self-aware work of contemporary literature that displays a typical postmodern playfulness with language, a fundamental skepticism toward authorship and mimesis, and a tendency to destabilize the concept', 'starting with the very identity of the body writing\" (142).

In this respect, let us conclude this section by recalling Barthes's claim that a [...], contestation' (Barthes 1977). Barthes was of course referring to the work of a single author: by composing two 'creators' of a text, the act of translation serves to exponentially increase the complexity of these elements and the relations between them. Nonetheless, as the creator of simulacra, the translator's work involves understanding these relations as best as possible (although the translator's grasp will be always partial, perhaps even in both senses of the word) and representing them to create an effect of resemblance with respect to the source text, allowing readers of the target text to glimpse the multiple points of view captured in the translation. II. Source Text as Virtual Problem and Target as Actual Solution Having discuss\", ' in the writer marks a new direction in fiction and criticism. In the late 1960s, Roland Barthes’s “The Death of the Author” and Michel Foucault’s “What Is an Author?” moved the locus of meaning from the author to the reader. In Barthes’s words, “To [...]” (147). Similarly, Foucault disparaged the function of the author “as the principle of thrift in the proliferation of meaning” (159). These influential essays discouraged interpretations based on the reader’s knowledge of the writer in favor of readings that unleashed the free play of signification. In contrast, Barnes’s question heralds the return of the author. Noticing how many contemporary writers use famous authors as characters, critics have provided postmodern explanations for the trend Barnes illustrates. These explanations are fully informed by poststructural narrative theory, but they reassess the rhetorical effect of authorship. For example, in Postmortem Postmodernists: The Afterlife of the Author in Recent Narrative, Laura Sav', 'ough and rigorous of critics in the novel will never possess) does little to bring about the \"birth of the reader,\" in Roland Barthes\\' sense of the term. The densely metafictive text may appear to be (and indeed has been read as) \"a multidimensional [...]\" (Barthes 256), but overt narrative asides, as well as the very plot conventions of the mystery, offer a way to navigate, understand, and indeed manage the polyphony of the text. The \"ventriloquized\" voices that seemingly afford such diverse and diffuse pleasure are carefully staggered throughout the work, placed in such a way as to systematically lay bare and resolve the central enigma. Even passages and poems that are seemingly left to stand on their own (such as Ash\\'s poem on Swammerdam) are picked up later on and recast, by the principal characters, within the unfolding mystery. Again and again, passages and remarks are openly interpreted for the \"actual\" reader by the primary critics, and these (\"correct\") interpretations are narrativ', 'sm interact\" (38).

Somehow, Harold Bloom continues Barthes\\'s project by selectively killing some writers in The Western Canon: Books and Schools ofthe Ages. His dismissive treatment of recent recipients of the Nobel Prize in literature and of writers who generated articles he compiled into books is part of a telling history. These intricately linked agendas engender hostile reactions. Barbara Christian had earlier cried out in dismay at the critical turn of theoretical events in her \"Race for Theory.\" Why do theorists of one school play the deadly, eliminating game of subtractions when we can all easily toy with the healthier, inclusionary notion of addition? Moving from the world of abstractions to \"reality,\" Barthes\\'s statement killing the \"Author\"', \" . . Yet, Barthes' model of performativity can be taken only so far in the artists' case.

Whereas Bentham had intended the Auto-Icon as a secularisation of the afterlife, Broodthaers' film repeats and gently pokes fun at that ambition when the film's conversation with the dead looks less like the rational pastime of a committed materialist than like the delusional enterprise of a spiritualist.

This essay is not a matter of \"outing\" Delmira Agustini - indeed, nothing could be less interesting for the purpose of this article. Instead, the goal is to engage with the \"queer charms\" of \"El intruso,\" by attending to another erotic and poetic logic. Guy Hocquenghem has astutely noted that \"[o]urs is a phallic society, and the quality of pleasure is determined in relation to the phallus\" (95). His point, and the one that is worth considering in relation to \"El intruso,\" is one that challenges the phallus as governing symbol. The phallus has been central to many readings of the poem precisely because it is through the \"lock\" that the phallus is able to sing - rather than the lock.

There is no main action or theme ē The detective story thread provides a pretext for an account of the life and loves of the victim, which in turn is a pretext for a thrilling tale of fantasy and suspense which combines James Bond with medieval epic and a parody of the racier accounts of archeological digs.

The overall intention, says Rowland, is to enable him to come to his text 'as a reader' rather than an author; to give it the 'critical edge of research'. He supports this logic by quoting Barthes (1977, p. 148): 'the [...] of the author'. The rhetoric, then, is that the use of fiction offers a research understanding of silence. Does it work that way? Analysing the fiction's narrative structure suggests a traditional plot. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy finds girl after a little difficulty. There is a set of ' family' conflicts and the trick is to see how they can be resolved. Will Gerald learn to handle his role? Will he gain Nicola's confidence? Will Nicola become confident? Will Bill lose his Neanderthal nature? These issues are resolved rather neatly. It ought to be argued that life does not usually tie up its own loose ends and so it raises a central issue in research. This is the degree to which the desire to tell 'plausible stories' helps generate\", 'ng their own bodily fluids. Cannot this be taken for a metaphor for readers\\' freedom to impose their own interpretation (based on their own bodily experiences) on the narrative, especially when the novel is what Barthes calls a \"writerly\" text? \"The [...],\" Barthes wrote (Image 148), and \\n Tall Tales and Brief Lives: Angela Carter\\'s Nights at the Circus 175 death is exactly what awaits the Countess when her prisoners are born into their new life that enables them to narrate their own lives. However much Carter claims, both within the text and in her comments about the ending, to be inviting the reader to become a producer rather than a consumer of the text, the fact remains that she continues to exercise tight if inconspicuous control of the narrative throughout its duration. This raises interesting questions about how Barthes\\' advocacy of the writerly text is to be interpreted. According to Barthes, \"the writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world (the world a', 'akes the move and repeals it in the same moment (it can\\'t be decoded unless the move is made).

Roland Barthes, \"The Death of the Author\" \\n 16 NOVEL I FALL 1987 2.1 Textual Author It has been noted above that Ambrose\\'s main problem is a self-consciousness which prevents him from actively participating in life, and which ultimately gets him lost in the funhouse. The narrator of the story \"Lost in the Funhouse\" (unlike the narrator of \"Tonio Kroger\") is bedeviled by that same surplus of self-consciousness, so much so that he\\'s as lost in the funhouse of the text as Ambrose is in the funhouse of life. Like Ambrose, the narrator begins already lost in the funhouse (\"For whom is the funhouse fun?\"-first sentence of the story, 69) and, like Ambrose, he never gets out (\"He wishes he had never entered the funhouse. But he has\"--last paragra', 'tention. For Barthes it is language (and specifically writing) that creates the \"author.\" The text, as a child of language, is necessarily public and intersubjective. It is not reducible to individualistic or subjective intentions. For Barthes, \"the [...],\" hence, the author (or the scholar speaking on behalf of a dead author\\'s biography and supposed intention) can never claim any final authority over the text. Constituted as it is of a complex field of shared, public signs, the text\\'s significance can never be properly reduced to subjective intention, but must always remain an intersubjective phenomenon. In Barthes\\' model, the text thereby opens up into an indefinite, plurality of readings. However they do not become infinite or absolutely relativistic. Language and history remain substantial constraints, supporting a limited range of potentially valid readings. Barthes\\' argument does emphatically not support an oxymoronic form of absolute egalitarian relativism that might claim that all r', 'take, then, in equating the language of Finnegans Wake with hoarded waste, or, put another way, what is the relationship between litter and literature for Joyce? As an emblematic inkbottle, Shem\\'s house is the site of an \"inkbattle\"; it serves as a \"[...] of them origi nal, blend and clash,\" exemplifying Barthes\\'s notion of textuality.32 Because modern language is accumulative, an assemblage of the decayed languages that have preceded it, it shares a philosophical affinity with trash. A. R. Ammons makes this point in his 1993 long poem, Garbage, when he characterizes language as \"a waste of words, a flattened-down, smoothed-/over mesa of Styrofoam verbiage.\"33 Comparing the mind to a garbage dump, Ammons writes, \"[T]here is a mound,/too, in the poet\\'s mind dead language is hauled/off to and burned down on,\" and by its nature, poetry is \"a plentiful waste and/waste of plenty\" (20, 103). Joyce proposes this same conflation of language with material waste in the catalogue of Shem\\'s ink bottle,', ' an ontological conviction about the status of language (The Death and Return of the Author 143). Art seems able to generate itself without requiring much of the artist beyond \"a pure gesture of inscription\" (Barthes, Death 146). Barthes writes: \"As [...]\" (in Autorship 125). According to Barthes, Mallarme was the first to give priority to language over the author: \"In France, Mallarme was doubtless the first to see and foresee in its full extent the necessity to substitute language itself for the person who until then had been supposed to be its owner. For him, for us too, it is language which speaks, not the author; to write is, through a prerequisite impersonality [...] to reach the point where only language acts, \\'performs\\' and not \\'me\"\\' (Image-Music-Text 142). \" \"The author\\'s name characterizes a particular manner of existence of discourse.

But in Ashbery\\'s scenario, our freedom quickly becomes the marvelously ambiguous freedom to \"go.\" Have we-returning to Barthes\\'s language-been born as readers, freed from the oppressive mythic regime of the Author to make meaning on our own, or have we, like students, been dismissed from text? Claims of marginalization and disavowals of dominance have become so prevalent in poetry circles as to evoke a reversal of the famous image: the poetry world is a circle at whose circumference is everyone, its center no one. The relation between eccentricity and centrality in Ashbery\\'s poem is a fraught one.

What are the places in it where there is room for possible subjects?\" (\"What is an Author?\" 391). And this in turn redeploys and reappropriates Roland Barthes\\' position in \"The Death of the Author\" that restricts reading to a procedure in which \"[...]\" (Barthes, \"Death of the Author,\" 147). That might do for a dead author, but what if the author belongs to the undead? As Alfred Andersch lay sick and dying in 1980, he exclaimed, \"How does Jiinger manage to live so long? He is twenty years older than I am. And as for me...\" (Reinhardt, Alfred Andersch, 632). On the one hand, it is true. Jiinger cuts a remarkable figure simply for having had the benefit of much time. Not only did he persist with apparent ease and confidence until 1998, living on to just a few weeks short of his 103rd birthday, but he somehow managed to continue to write and produce significant work almost up to the last. On the other hand, one could argue that he had died long before. The person to whom Jiinger had always ', 'course, Pirandello\\'s Six Characters who, once placed on the stage of writing by the Author, act out their dramas independent of his presence. \"To give a text an Author\"-that is, to accept his/her intentions as its single \"theological\" meaning-is to \"[...].\" So Barthes banishes the Author from his privileged domain: \"It is not that the Author may not \\'come back\\' in the Text, in his text, but he then does so as a guest.\" Barthes\\'s argument is partly analytical, partly historical. He notes that the concept of the Author is a product of English empiricism, French rationalism, and Protestant individualist faith. That the Author-function, particularly as defined by law, is a modern historical creation, is a point made similarly by M. M. Bakhtin and Michel Foucault.

This characterisation of the writing function directly contradicts Henry James' conceptualisation of the unique and \", 'f lifeless signs into meanings. It is on the basis of this understanding that a concourse can emerge between art and Being. But that is not the usual way things go in a modernist philosophy of art. Roland Barthes, for example, famously averred that “[...].”41 Barthes is glossing the idea, going back at least to the Phaedrus, that writing throws up a barrier between souls. Socrates (or Plato) thought that the problem was specifi cally with writing, an act that dries up dialectic’s lifeblood; with Barthes, it seems as if the signs are dead to begin with, that the problem is with language itself, spoken as much as written. Yet language, Goehring.indd 70 5/17/2018 4:56:55 PM \\n on being ❧ 71 including writing, can also open up our psychic life to ourselves and to others. Words are like gondoliers of the soul, as someone once said. To be able to put a name to a feeling is to mature, to recognize one’s self and others more fully. That is what Ian McEwan is getting at in The Innocent in describing ', 'ting a text but is unavailable for interpreting it. But whereas Foucault a year later would offer fresh proposals for the text itself as the source of meaning, Barthes locates meaning in the reader: \\n The Dialogic Function of Composition Pedagogy 55 [...]. (129) And that reader, Barthes declares, is without history; he or she can only be described in terms of the person reading at the moment of reading, not in terms of that reader as a collective or unified, transtemporal subject. Foucault, too, attests the death of the author: “It is obviously insufficient to repeat empty slogans: the author has disappeared; God and man died a common death” (Barthes 121). His essay “What Is an Author?” focuses on the name of the author and how readers construct from the text an “author” that may have little or nothing to do with the person who composed the text. An author’s name differs from other proper names in that it functions as a means of classifying texts and establishing relationships among them: a', 's basically that between the \"modern scriptor\" and the \"Author\" dis cussed by Roland Barthes in his \"The Death of the Author.\" At issue here is a difference in the temporality defining the relations between these two fig ures and their writing: \"The [...]. ...

Roland Barthes commented upon this sort of traditional criticism in his seminal 1968 essay \"The death of the author,\" \"The [...]\" (1977, 143-emphasis in the original). Barthes\\'s starting point for this essay is a comment in a short story by Balzac about the typically feminine behaviour of Sarassine, a castrato disguised as a woman. Barthes poses the question, Who is saying that his/her behaviour is typically feminine-is it the character in the story, or o Balzac himself, or is it the \"common sense\" opinion of the historical period which Balzac reproduces without conscious intention? By emphasising the significance of aspects of the story that are not under the author\\'s conscious control, Barthes demonstrates the existence of unconscious associations and internalised ideologies which form works of art and are articulated in them. To what extent did Graham, like Balza', 'ionist thought, and holds that since we can never know exactly what the author intended, meanings are made in interpretation, not creation. So readers and the texts themselves became the primary forces behind making meaning. In Barthes\\'s words, \"The [...]\" (Ibid., 148). What Barthes and subsequent poststructuralists don\\'t say, however, is that the valorization of the reader has resulted in the increased prestige of their own theoretical works, and themselves as the authors of them. 33. Edward Said writes that \"it is probably correct to say that it does not finally matter who wrote what, but rather how a work is written and how it is read\" (\"The Politics of Knowledge,\" Raritan 11 (Summer 1991), 31, emphasis in original).

The voice in epitaphs is often ambiguous—possibly the personifi ed stone, possibly the deceased him or herself, but in the Parentalia, the poet removes any doubt that he is the speaker by placing himself in this sentence with meorum. Though some argue that late antique prefaces are an abnegation of responsibility, in the case of the Parentalia, Ausonius takes full responsibility for the text’s beginning in remarking on his inability to control its future.

Does the rising control of the performer and recordist over so many compositional elements herald the “death” of the iconic composer before the music even reaches its audience?

In many of Barthes's critical essays of the I96os, the effect of the compelling invitation to the reader to cease being a passive consumer and to become an active producer of signification cannot be underestimated. However, there is a real danger of making a fetish of such an idea to the extent that an enabling exhortation can become a reiterated commonplace. I fear that this dominant theoretical underpinning, encapsulated in Graniela- Rodriguez's advocacy of 'un mayor activismo por parte de quien lee' (p. v) or her repeated approval of a narrative discourse in which there is 'una progresiva desaparici6n \", \"/?Death of the Fictional Character?/. This ?multi-vocal? enterprise of Cixous and Fuentes intersects with the complementary idea of the ?death of the author.? According to Roland Barthes (in his essay on ?The Death of the Author?), ?for Mallarm? for [...], 'performs,' and not 'me.' In this performance, ?the text is a tissue of quota tions drawn from the innumerable centres of culture.?* Consideration of the multi-vocal qualities of literature thus leads to recognition of its inter textual nature, when the different voices come from other literary texts. The theoretical breaking down of the notion of individual authors as generators of texts is related to another critical issue, to the blurring of distinctions between ?writers? and ?critics.? This tendency is not new; think only?particularly in this context?of Don Quixote as an extended critical discourse on novels of chivalry, of Virginia Woolf's essays, or of Borges' meditations on other writers. But interest in the theoretical implica tio\", ' press and later to conceptualizations of intellectual property and the forging of copyright laws. Roland Barthes is often called on in this scholarship for contesting the prospect of “originality” in authorship, defining a composition instead as “a [...]” so much that “the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original” (146). Michel Foucault conceives Western views of the author as either heroic (since, historically and culturally, texts have been viewed as religiously transcended, sacred, creative, and original works) or dead (since the form and product of writing outlives the life of the author and since it is not evident to readers that the author is a historically, socially, and culturally shaped individual). Both Barthes and Foucault, therefore, critique normalized assumptions and practices that inaccurately position the author as original, autonomous, or detached from historical and cultural contexts. They help us see that authorship is necessarily about b', 'I situate Histoire within a fascinating intertext of first person work within the cinematic essay genre from the period of the late 20th century.

Preparing the way for Histoire, this first ‘narcissistic’ iteration of Ivens’s invocation of his childhood and his summation of his career climaxes in an intense and uncharacteristically personal and ‘perilous’ discussion of his special relationship with China, to which he and Loridan would soon return to ‘do right by’ after the shame of ‘cheating’ the Chinese (Schoots, | 627 [1995] 2000, 349). The discussion finally alights on friendship, both with their Chinese friends who have weathered the flux of the last two decades even more than the', ' text—give the lie to thé ontological necessity (or anti-ontological necessity) of his absence in the novel itself. By his absence Mensonge remains the purest instance of the death of the author, living proof of Roland Barthes\\'s famous comment that \"[...].\" Barthes, who apparently meant by his phrase \"the death of the author\" something not quite identical to the Ayatollah Khomeini\\'s literal reading of the term, claims that the literary author—the kind of author who goes around signing copies, claiming authority and wisdom for the books he or she likes to think she or he wrote, and suggesting indeed that the text has accurately presented \"reality\"—is an invention of bourgeois mercantile capitalism. Given the politics of the time this review is being written, the opening remarks of Bradbury\\'s \"The Man with the Grey Flannel Head,\" a letter addressed to \"Mr. Rushdie\" about refusing to prostitute art to commercial and political pressures, seem uncannily prescient: In the literary circles in whic', 'ost to lead to something like Roland Barthes\\'s radical pronouncement of \"the death of the Author,\" namely, that the liberated critic is engaged not in deciphering the authorial intention as the final signified but in working his or her own way in a \"[...].\"30 Thus the critic participates in the traversing of that space with his or her own writing, which is no less original than that of the artist, producing a personal text as creative as literature itself. Frye\\'s mythological or archetypal criticism is based on the notion of literature as \"a * displaced\\' mythology,\" a structure of perennial and recurring myths, images, and archetypes that connect individual works with one another to form a tradition and help to \"unify and integrate our literary experience.\"31 The view that literature takes \\n Zhang Longxi • 96 shape in the recurrence of archetypes inevitably lays special emphasis on the importance of form and the constitutive role of conventions. As Frye puts it, \"Poetry can only be made out', \" extent to which the writer is always already written, caught in the play of a system which precedes and exceeds him/ her, and which can function satisfactorily in the author's absence, as Barthes argues, for instance, in 'The Death of the Author': '[...] writing'.5 This is a recurring theme of the Livre des questions sequence; the epigraph of the first volume raises this issue in its address to the writer, any writer: 'Tu es celui qui écrit et qui est écrit.' (Livre des questions , 9) (You are the one who writes and is written.) In Yaël Jabès remarks that: 'Le livre n'a pas besoin de l'homme pour se faire; il se fait à travers lui.' ( Yaël , 1 60) (The book has no need of man to take form; it takes form through him.) This notion of the redundancy of the writer suggests an interruption between writer and text taking the form of a disjunctive void, a situation which Jabès explicitly relates to the death of the writer in Aely : Aller à la mort, faire sa mort comme on cherche, ailleurs, à fair\", 'for meaning, and its ultimate potential for deconstruction. On the one hand, in “The Death of the Author,” Barthes dreams of writing practices that ceaselessly and systematically evaporate meaning: Thus literature (it would be better, henceforth, to [...] to the text (and to the world as text) a “secret”: that is, an ultimate meaning, liberates an activity which we might call counter-theological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to arrest meaning is finally to refuse God and his hypostases, reason, science, the law. (Barthes 5) Barth’s figurative killing of the author is the first element of a chain reaction that would lead to the erasure of ultimate meaning, of God, and of other categories that up to that point had been intended to offer meaning. On the other hand, Barth invites the postmodern author to survive his/her finitude and metaphorical death in order to “accomplish new human work” (Barth 70), and, like the mystics, access a different mode of existence where one’s ability to p', \"he world economy, limit its applicability. Barthes's wonderful description of the text in 'The Death of the Author' could be adapted to describe the nation that is attempting to remake itself, substituting the autocratic ruler for the Author- God: A [...].7 Mudrooroo uses this quotation in the final chapter of Writingfrom the Fringe, when he focuses on 'Centring the Fringe'. In it he addresses the question of nationalism and whether Aboriginal people can participate in Australian nationality or whether they need separatism; in terms of Aboriginal history there are obviously links with black history in South Africa, though the differences are as significant as the similarities. Looking at a map of a typical Australian city, Mudrooroo sees a multi-dimensional space, variously inscribed: Street names, road names, for example: Burbong Road. 'Burbong' is a signifier of Aboriginality; 'road', of Europeanness, and if we extend this further both constitute a signifier of Australianness, and in a de\", ' Brenda K.

According to Julia Kristeva, \"a text works by absorbing and destroying at the same time the other texts of the intertextual space\" (cited in Marshall, 1992, p. 130). In all cases, an identity in need of further development does so in relation with other identities, negotiating a relational space between \"Self and \"Other\" as a reflective opportunity for identity formation, critical action, and worldbuilding.

She is responding to Barthes\\'s critical turn from the practice of piercing a text in search of its \"secret\" toward an understanding of writing as something \"to be ranged over,\" as that which \"[...] it\" and which for Barthes is achieved through what he calls the \"Death of the Author\" (147). Felski shows the form of critique advanced by the \"Death of the Author\" to be a mode of, rather than departure from, the \"hermeneutics of suspicion\"; Wicomb here nudges us out of this position and that of the earlier Mythologies (1957) to the later Barthes of A Lover\\'s Discourse (1977) and Camera Lucida (1980), in which he performs \"expressive\" as much as \"critical\" reading (Camera 8) and\\' permits himself to be \"pierced\" by the \"punctum\" of the photograph.

It remains one of the finest studies in the field. Posthumous texts bearing Barthes’s name existed at the time, of course; the three-volume Œuvres complètes (Paris: Seuil, \\uf644\\uf64c\\uf64c\\uf646–\\uf64c\\uf648), for example, had been published earlier in the decade. But since \\uf644\\uf64c\\uf64c\\uf64b there has been a transformative flood. As the Los Angeles Review of Books put it in \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf645: ‘Lately the posthumous corpus of Roland Barthes has been growing at a rate that rivals Tupac Shakur’s.

It is in this sense that Barthes can write in one of his 1968 texts: '[...] through which our subject escapes, the black-and-white where all identity gets lost, beginning with that of the very body doing the writing' (III, 40). 31 In the preceding years, that was also what Blanchot had written.32 In his numerous texts, \\n R/M , Í953 75 Blanchot had put a repeated gesture to the test: in his articles, a search for how each writer brings out and apportions the neuter in an original creative work; in his récits , a pursuit of the anonymous movement whereby each singular ordeal [épreuve] dissolves into an indefinite experience. He therefore gave noun status at that time to the neuter, against philosophy which could be said to have always been afraid of it, and in favour of writing, which was alone in being receptive to\", 'in the first meetings of the seminar in December 1978. Barthes reflected upon his long-held theory of writing (écriture) as an action whose end is the satisfaction of its own illogical imperatives: a movement, as he elsewhere remarked, in which \"the [...].\"7 In an earlier version of the argument, he had declared the verb \"to write\" to be intransitive in its modern designation of literary performance, and he cited as evidence of its objectless, nonreferential status the shifting, illusory nature of the first-person pronoun: \"the / of the one who writes I is not the same as the I which is read by thou.\"s In exposing the fictionality of the \"I\" of writing, Barthes found proof of an absolute disjunction between self and text: no matter how \"sincere\" writing seems to be, its professed innocence is a species of imposture. Over the years, this viewwhich first surfaced in Writing Degree Zero (1953)- had evolved into a complex theory of the artificiality of all discourse and, notoriously, into the c', 't that occurs in me when I want to dismantle the game but instead seem, at best, to change only the rules?

That is, the student embodied in experience is not taught to value experience (except experience that teaches students that to succeed one must play by the rules), is not taught to value the subjective, nor to value the cultural knowledge he or she brings to the classroom. Students are taught to leave the \"I,\" the \"me,\" and the \"we\" on the doorsteps of their homes. In school only \"objectified\" knowledge is valued, not anecdotal situations, not relations grounded in personal experience, and not presence but the absence of it.

On the one hand, it wipes away the significance of the author to writing and criticism—and opens the pathway for structural and poststructuralist critical approaches to the author. On the other hand, it restores the position of the autho', 'ssue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture,\" intertextuality can proclaim the death of the author-the displacement of a totalizing figure or any notion of a centralizing authority-and instate a semiosis or a theory of signs, a \"[...]\" (Barthes 146). At one extreme, the sign itself is called into question; the stable, transparent and evident relationship between the signifier and signified no longer obtains, leading to a crisis in representation or a mise en abime of any self-legitimating claims to knowledge. Still Julia Kristeva\\'s classic formulation that intertextuality is \"the passagefrom one sign system to another\" recognizes its broad intraand intercultural function, not limited to language per se, where all discursive practices can be assimilated to sign systems.1 Linda Hutcheon sees in Kristeva\\'s proposals \"the irreducible plurality of texts within and behind any given text\" (6) while Thais Morgan also concludes on this basis that as \"one text can connect signifi', '8 implications of this view.

Therefore language can only refer to itself. Let me anticipate objections to the relevance of linguistic theory either to Farrer or to theodicy. Farrer himself is concerned to emphasize the hermeneutics of human investigation of the Creation. Man, once endowed with speech, starts making an inventory of the universe. The speaker, having l', 'individual \\'reads\\' what he has labelled, including himself. According to Barthes, it is not the author but the reader who \\'makes\\' a \\n 8o GOD IN THEORY text, by interpretation. The author is not the begetter or father of his text: rather the hand ... [...] allorigins.23 Therefore no text has a definable single or \\'ultimate meaning\\', for it has the many \\'meanings\\' readers make as they peruse it. Barthes regards this \\'liberation\\' of the text from \\'a \"secret\", ultimate meaning\\' as involving \\'an anti-theological activity\\' because it implies the denial of \\'meaning\\' itself. If we accepted this analysis we would have to abandon Farrer\\'s analogy altogether—and the tradition behind it—for if there are no authors there are no replications of divine authorship and no divine authorship either. Barthes argues that no text is original, \\'authored\\', because all texts endlessly replicate the literary gestures of other texts, and this is also the source of cultural determination. This literature is essentiall', \"', because all texts endlessly replicate the literary gestures of other texts, and this is also the source of cultural determination. This literature is essentially form not 'meaning'. Equally, a multiphcity of potential meanings follows because the [...] ... a text is made of multiple writings ... but there is one place where this multiplicity is focussed and that place is the reader ... a text's unity lies not in its origin but in its destination.24 We have already suggested that, to refine Farrer's model, the point of analogy is precisely its 'difference': that the human scriptor is linguistically and conceptually different from the divine author. The divine author may be conceived in terms of intentionalism but the human scriptor cannot. Therefore, if we take on board Barthes' description of the cultural determination of texts, we could place it alongside Farrer's characterization of sin as culturally and linguistically determined. This would define the limitations of writers and especi\", \" 'innocence' of the author's creative impulses, recent literary theory has been faithful to the key tenets of poststructuralism and deconstruction. The author/subject is seen as a creation of the text rather than vice versa, the text itself being 'a [...] and clash'2 and where repeatable signs are detached from 'all reference to a center, to a subject, to a privileged preference, [or] to an origin'.3 The word 'radical' in its sense 'of or going to the root or origin'4 seems to stand in direct contrast to such premises. In the less ironic sense, however, it addresses questions of poetic voice and openness to perception and experience. It calls forth a stance that prevents poetry to be frozen by fixed notions of literary or cultural memory and the acknowledging of its necessary embeddedness to the surrounding world and its phenomena. Rather than a yearning after the Romantics' notions of pure and original creative individual spirit, the notion here operates in interplay with the intertextual \", 'thout content. Yet hyper-pluralism qualifies the very existence of extra-literary values as interpretation seems to become an almost accidental response to literature. In Roland Barthes\\'s hyperbole, contrary to creating something \\'original\\', \" . . .

Of course, even in the revolutionary year 1968 authors were not being plucked out of their studies and being shot. What Barthes was really announcing through this hyperbole was a new mode of interpretation: \"[...]\" (147). Conversely, to remove writing from the authority of the author is to declare it open. And given that it was 1968, this openness was assigned by Barthes a precise political value: \"to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases-reason, science, law\" (147). Barthes\\'s brief essay, \"The Death of the Author,\" is a crucial compendium of the themes of what later came to be called poststructuralism. At times, Barthes sounds like Jacques Derrida: \"writing is the destruction of every voice, of every point of origin\" (142). At times, a bit more like Louis Althusser: \"Language knows a \\'subject,\\' not a person\" (145). At other times, like Michel Foucault: \"Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique space where our sub', 'textual interpretation rather than as an attempt to understand the ideological effect of the author\\'s articulative status. Consequently, with both theorists discussing the work of Balzac, Barthes asks, \"Who is speaking thus?\" (125), answering, \"[w]e [...]\" (125). Benveniste\\'s answer to the same question, on the other hand, is \"there is no longer even a narrator. ... No one speaks here; events seem to tell themselves\" (241). Both theorists posit an authorial absence, but Barthes argues for this absence in order to reclaim interpretative pluralism, whereas Benveniste claims that this absence is predicated upon a myth of interpretative pluralism from an ideologically concealed author. Barthes does not seek to understand the ideological impact of presenting or concealing authorial enunciation, as Benveniste does, because his author is always already \"dead,\" and enunciative traces are merely critical attempts to \"impose a limit on [... a] text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the ', 'hor?\" by linking authorship historically to immortality, Barthes insists in his \"The Death of the Author\" that it is actually the mortal author who makes the reader immortal.

One underlying question, then, for this paper (and for a compositional criticism) is whether there has to be an absolute \"eitheror\" situation in terms of text as a \"field without origin - or which, at least, has no other origin than language itself, language which ceaselessly calls into question all origins\" (Barthes 146), or the text as the authorised product of a single mind. At first sight any middle ground would seem to be impossible: if you have asserted the \"death of the author\" you can\\'t also resuscitate him.

Thus is revealed the total existence of writing: a text is made of multiple writings, drawn from many cultures and entering into mutual relations of dialogue, parody, contestation, but there is one place where the multiplicity is focused and that place is the reader, not, as was hitherto said, the author. (142, 148) We argue that Samuel Beckett\\'s novel, The Unnamable , that Berio heavily quotes in the third movement of Sinfonia , is post-structuralist - \"Of the more than 1,400 words of spoken and sung text in the Berio movement,\" writes Hicks, \"more than two-thirds are from Beckett\" (211). Because Beckett\\'s novel is better understood in the context of Lacanian schizophrenia, there is a further reason for identifying it with post-stu', 'rthes\\'s 1968 essay, \"The Death of the Author,\" in which he wrote that Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with the very identity of the body writing. . . .

Because knowledge is shaped in part by culture, every reader is privileged. When Barthes 30 \\n (148) writes that \"a text\\'s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination,\" and includes said essay in a book entitled Image , Music and Text , we can surely generalize that usage of \"destination\" to audiences for books, plays, art, music and so forth.

The philosophical death is established on the basis of a reflection upon the meaning of writing itself. \"Writing,\" says Barthes, \"is the black-and-white [...].\" Closely related is the critical death-the notion that texts can (and should) be read without reference to their putative authors. This is a \"countertheological\" move, insofar as those authors are otherwise treated as \"Author-gods\" determining all meaning. Neither the philosophical nor critical deaths require any empirical justification; they are a priori assertions about all writing and reading, rather than reading and writing as situated in society and history. By contrast, social and textual births and deaths must be established by recourse to social and textual facts, in a particular time and place.

The textual death results from a new kind of text-reconceptualized, in his later S/Z as \"writerly\"-deliberately constructed so as to allow language itself to speak, revealing itself as \"a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture\" (\"The Death of the Author\" 146). Such a text (foregrounding the intertext, though Barthes didn\\'t use this term) implies the death of the author, and the simultaneous birth of the reader as writer.

One is thus entitled to ask precisely when and where these assertions are true. Writing in a somewhat less polemical vein, Foucault\\'s essay Alif 23 (2003) 83 \\n (\"What is an Author?\") more directly problematizes the author, by tracing a socially, historically, and discursively variable \"author-function,\" an individualization evolving with ', \" that they shall have their meanings.

The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture. In this brief consideration of Kosinski's last four works of fiction, the second 'half of his published work, I suggest that there is a pattern of change in the work, in the nature of the painted bird protagonist as in the language strategies. It is a change which is evident in spite of the continuation of particular interests such as the ambivalent position of the loner, emphasis on the existential present, eroticism and violence, and interest in the shock effect of events and language.

Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale [New York: Vintage, 1968] 267). Friedrich D. E. Schleiermacher remarks on the ubiquity of interpretation earlier (c. 1819), in his recently edited manuscripts, trans. J. Duke and J. Forstman (The Hermeneutics Reader: Texts of the German Tradition from the Enlightenment to the Present, ed. Kurt Mueller-Vollmer [New York: Continuum, 1988] 81-86).

Whilst Roland Barthes urged us to think about the [...]’, assemblage, I suggest, extends this interpretation and re-spaces these texts into the fissures and flows of the social, the material and the geographical.67 Like the qualities of the rhizome identified by Deleuze and Guattari, theories of assemblage presses us to encounter the more-than-representational qualities of the geographical imagination, and insist that it generally has ‘no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things’.68 Hence, assemblage is particularly effective in revealing the missionary enterprise as a series of transactions across space, and indeed between domains of faith located in Heaven and Earth. Assemblage offers the potential to situate ‘the geographical’ within missionary activities, by recognizing ', 'terpretation, through critical exegesis of, for example, Finnegans Wake or Alice in Wonderland , even though the hermeneutic procedures are various or contrary. Such unities as these , then, may come from the reader, as Roland Barthes suggests: \\'The [...] but in its destination\\' (\\'The Death of the Author\\', p. 148). But such a position does not really preclude a unity constructed by the author; whether an author \\'intended\\' a particular unity is probably undecidable, but even the deconstructive critics find unities in texts under their scrutiny and even use unity as a positive value in judgement. Geoffrey Hartman, for one, can show his admiration for Northrop Frye\\'s assumption of unity: \\'Frye (...) corrects Eliot by showing that Blake is terrifying not only because of his honesty but because of the \"fearful symmetry\" or \"total form\" that articulates his poetry as minutely as does any borrowed medieval system\\' (Culture of Criticism\\', p. 390).

To be like a literary character in the Dostoevskean- Bakhtinian sense, is to act out of character; to reach out of our given or fabricated frames; to resist our own desire for the safe haven of aesthetic containment. Dostoevsky\\'s abdication of the authorial prerogative is not merely a different mode of writing. What makes his move so revolutionary, Copernican indeed, is the implicit transition from an aesthetic to an ethical mode of authoring and being. The Bakhtinian-Dostoevkean shift from aesthetics to ethics is more than a poetic revolution: it is a paradigm shift of much wider-reaching philosophical potency.

Marrison (1986:276), for example, commented on \\'the accepted attitude to authorship\\' in Bali, noting that, in general, \\'authorship was anonymous, and there was not a strong feeling of personal property in a text\\'.

Moreover, the writer does not only court death but in some sense must already be dead before embarking on her career: the writer \"must assume the role of the dead man in the game of writing\" (198). The uncanny nature of the \"author-function\" derives from its hostility to the writer, a hos tility predicated on their incomplete dissociation. Thus, the author and the writer be come hostile twins, a Jek', \"ili l'uno all'altro' (p. I07), meaning that a 'senso totale' escapes everyone, including the poet himself. The 'actual' meaning of the text never corresponds therefore to the intention of the poet (p. 93). 49 Roland Barthes makes these connections: '[...])' ('The Death of the Author', trans. by Stephen Heath, in Modem Criticism and Theory. A Reader, ed. by David Lodge (London and New York: Longman, 1988), pp. I67-72 (p. I68)). The association of Joyce and Mallarm6 with the 'canon' of poststructuralist literature is evident. Joyce figures strongly in the work of many Italian and French theorists. Umberto Eco's Opera aperta:.forma e indeterminazione nelle poetiche contemporanee (Milan: Bompiani, 1976) is partly a commentary on Joyce, above all on Finnegans Wake and Ulysses. Tel Quel also dedicated substantial space to discussions of Joyce during the I96os (Tel Quel, 30 (I967), 56-89). For an account of the role of Joyce within French theory, see Post-Structuralist Joyce: Essays from the Frenc\", 'ure of the Author, bringing forth the text as “a multi-dimensional space” in which a multiplicity of writings mix, blend, and clash.

Although the first of these two essays r estricts itself to the singular relationship between Author and text, the second deals more numerously with those internal and external constraints that function to restrict the horizons structuring discourse. Both works are replies to criticisms that The Order of Things sublated complex differences between Buffon, Linnaeus, Darwin, and Ricar', 'ente: o autor morto na ace pçâo de Roland Barthes: once an action is recounted, for intransitive ends, and no longer in order to act directly upon reality—that is, finally external to any function but the very exercise of the symbol—this disjunction [...], (s. p.)

As a kind of reinvention of early modern diary form, blogs trade heavily on the conventions of diary writing, including especially the rhetorics of sincerity and immediacy. As public texts, however, blogs resemble other important modes of expression characteristic of modern print-culture, including the eighteenth-century broadsheets like the Tatler and The Spectator. Just as with the early broadsheets, many blogs are published anonymously, or more specifically, pseudonymously. Blogging pseudon', 'iven historical period; more importantly that words have different meanings for different people at different times in different cultures. Thus, instead of being the product of one culture as Picard would have it, the work (Barthes prefers the term \"[...]\" (Image, Music, Text 148). We should recall here that in Criticism and Truth Barthes does not deny the existence of \"historical meanings\" but associates them with contingency. He claims that \"whatever societies think or decree, the work goes beyond them, travels through them, in the manner of a form which is filled [. . .] by more or less contingent and historical meanings\" (69). Barthes, then, counters Picards historical-period-and-sources syllogisms by questioning \"historical meanings\" and talking instead about \"multiple writings\" and \"mutual relations.\" \"We now know,\" says Barthes in his famous 1968 essay, \"The Death of the Author,\" \"that a text is not a line of words releasing a single \\'theological\\' meaning (the message of the Author-G', \"and by language. If a text draws attention to its own tropologica! mechanisms, it calls into question the nature and function of the author. Barthes has proposed that the time of individualization in writing has passed, that writing has become 'that [...] away' and that 'the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author'.9 Barthes 's argument is useful, in that \\n 54 Paragraph it moves focus from an impossibly locatable biographical personage to a reader who is 'without history, biography, psychology', but, as Foucault has pointed out in his response to Barthes's theory, we must be wary of relegating the mark of the writer to the singularity of his absence.10 For Foucault, the author is 'a certain functional principle by which, in our culture, one limits, excludes and chooses [. . .] the author is the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning' (159). In this respect, the author's name is the means by which we reduce th\", 'ack to his relationship to language, insofar as it seems to constitute another, as-yetuncommented-on, textual fragment that The Auto-Bio-Graph has incorporated into itself, namely, a paraphrase of a line from Barthes’s “The Death of the Author”: “We [...]’ meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash.”21 In this case, the degraded function of the penis — no longer an organ of reproduction and phallic mastery but merely of urination — figures the action of “releasing” the “meaning” of “the Author-God” as a stream of urine.

Most of this paradox is eliminated easily enough if we accept the argument that the records placing the book in the library i', 'terary and critical theory.

In part 3 of his essay, Manovich quotes Roland Barthes, who defined the cultural [...] of culture without any privileged centre of meaning. This specific notion concerning the general openness of the text also includes the traditional role of its author, whose function as the essential creator of his own text Barthes radically denied in his famous 1968 essay “La mort de l’auteur” (“The Death of the Author”). In it, Barthes splits the author’s position in two: the auteur plays the traditional role as the privileged and authorized creator of text, who is able to live a life also outside the text; whereas the modern scripteur exists only within the text, as more its product than its creator, and does not claim to be imposing any first-hand interpretation of that text. On the contrary, according to Barthes, the scripteur acts le', ' 45-46). The vain attempt to totally identify or engage with the author demonstrates a contradiction and ultimately shows the elusive essence of the author, absent precisely where his or her firm presence is expected to be. The \"death of the Author\" [...] by way of multiplicity and through the lack of a fixed end point. Barthes perceives this \"evaporation\" of origins as an overcoming of the post positivist phase of the \"Author\\'s empire\" (50-54). It may also be the case for Mallarmé, Valéry, and the Surrealists, but not so for Joyce, in whose work the reigning identity and dissolution of the author are most definitely consistent and united. If the purpose of Portrait is to \"unite the person and work,\" which are \"tyrannically centered on the author,\" in Finnegans Wake instead occurs a depersonalisation in which \"it is language which speaks, and not the author\" (see Barthes 50). Furthermore, Ulysses is both an artist\\'s novel (\"there\\'s a touch of the artist [even] about old Bloom,\" Joyce, Ulyss', 'ined by perspective, focus, and attention.

Groppe, building on the work of Peter L. Bergeri The Sacred Canopy, argues that \"language does its task of ordering experience by establishing patterns of recurrence,\" and \"the more stable the world view, the more relaxed and unobtrusive the repetition can be\" (168).

Both axis of intertextuality––via the writer (who is the first reader) and the readers (who are co-producers of textual meaning)––allow the “dialogism” or “heteroglossia” (exchange of language in M. Bakhtin’s understanding) of texts to work in the genesis of meaning.7 The processes of readingand meaning-production are always dialogues between the writers and the readers. The authority of interpretation does not reside in the frozen text or in the first writer, but is to be found in the interactive process of the text, involving both the writer and the reader, which I have previously termed “rhetorical interaction”. 8 Gadam', 'e 3. still image from Milcho Manchevski, Dust (2001) Manchevski, like the experimentalist James Benning, likes to point at the rectangular movie screen and assert, in any public situation, that it’s all, in some sense, a fiction, all constructed: at [...] is art and craft, contrivance and manipulation.

Barthes would remind critics how extremely convenient authors are as sources of meaning — \"once the author is found, the text is \\'explained\\'\" — but he goes on to reject, in poststructural fashion, our obviously bourgeois desire \"to impose a break\" on the work, \"to furnish it with a final signified, to close reading\" (1986, p. 53). In this way Barthes expands the properties of the text while at the same time treating our common, closed approaches to writing and our valuing of the writer as the product of a historical moment. That still leaves a question mark around the urge to write. Why is there this intense interest in investing in such properties, as if they were lakeside retrea', 'for meaning, and its ultimate potential for deconstruction. On the one hand, in “The Death of the Author,” Barthes dreams of writing practices that ceaselessly and systematically evaporate meaning: Thus literature (it would be better, henceforth, to [...] to the text (and to the world as text) a “secret”: that is, an ultimate meaning, liberates an activity which we might call counter-theological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to arrest meaning is finally to refuse God and his hypostases, reason, science, the law. (Barthes 5) Barth’s figurative killing of the author is the first element of a chain reaction that would lead to the erasure of ultimate meaning, of God, and of other categories that up to that point had been intended to offer meaning. On the other hand, Barth invites the postmodern author to survive his/her finitude and metaphorical death in order to “accomplish new human work” (Barth 70), and, like the mystics, access a different mode of existence where one’s ability to p', 'that \"the voice [of the text] loses its origin\" (1977: 142) with a quotation from a fictional work (a Balzac story), and one cast in free indirect style at that. Yet his death sentence explicitly extends to the authors of nonliterary texts as well: \"[...]) .. .\" (1977: 144-45). Only two years earlier (in \"Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative\"), Barthes had seemingly limited the absence of the author to fiction, merely explaining that \"the (material) author . .. is in no way to be confused with the narrator,\" since \"narrator and characters . . . are essentially \\'paper beings\\'\" (1977: 111). 30. Sternberg (1983: 176) refers to \"the built-in discrepancy between speaker and author\" in fiction and, on this basis, explains what he calls the \"bi-dimensionality of motivation that distinguishes it from all discourse with no inherent tensions between formal speaker(s) and covert manipulator\" (ibid.: 179-80). 31. The vocal distinction between author and narrator serves as a starting poi', '\"We are no longer willing to be the dupes of such antiphrases, by which a society proudly recriminates in favor of precisely what it discards, ignores, muffles, or destroys: we know that in order to restore writing to its future, we must reverse the [...] of the Author\" (1986, 55). In the end, we have mis taken the author for her creation by assigning to her work inferences that provide a sense of closure she did not necessarily intend to give us.This is not to say tht Kate Chopin could not have anticipated our bringing Edna\\'s sui cide into our readings. It is a compelling way of reading the text that is not \\n Robert Treu 35 likely to disappear. On the other hand, freeing the text from this assumption and putting it back in the hands of the readers has important implications for future discussions of The Awakening. The strong differences among the arguments offered by critics of The Awakening to support their readings is a healthy expression of the dialogue that has gone forward since Kate ', 'the book, for the author of the book \"is annihilated by its publication.\" 279 \\n 280/Duras\\'s The North China Lover These struggles and contradictions mirror somewhat Roland Barthes\\'s discussion of writing in \"The Death of the Author.\" Barthes notes, \"[...]\" (142). Although both Barthes and Duras posit writing as a sort of absence (Duras calls the book \"the unknown\" and Barthes calls writing \"the negative where all identity is lost\"), it would seem that for both authors this absence is caused not so much by a lack, as by an overabundance of voices and discourses in which any singular voice becomes lost. In \"From Work to Text,\" Barthes discusses the role of the author and the author\\'s life in relation to the work: \"his life is no longer the origin of his fictions but a fiction contributing to his work; there is a reversion of the work on to the life (and no longer the contrary). ... the / which writes the text, it too, is never more than a paper-/\" (161). In The North China Lover , Duras plays', 'rse: the construction of a tradition. What is produced is neither \"Woman\" nor \"Truth\" in all the fiction of its essential unity. Rather, Riddles calls into question this fiction of coherence by constructing woman within a cinematic \"multidimensional [...].\"12 \\n 107 Could you discuss the contribution of psychoanalytic theory to Riddles : the references to the Mirror Phase , the use of the Imaginary and the Symbolic , and the politics of the unconscious ?13 LM: The film is colored by psychonalysis, and I\\'ve been very influenced by it.

In the rest of the film, where there is an inspiration from psychoanalysis, it\\'s more implied than specific-giv', 'he metaphorical death of the author appeals so strongly to Everett; he is profoundly opposed to limitations, finalities, and closures of meaning, particularly those that arise from an interpretive process in which the “explanation of a work is . . . [...]’ in us” (143). Everett does not “confide” in his reader or engage in overt didacticism because he ultimately believes that “the work is smarter than I am. Art is smarter than us . . . I have no desire to offer a political message in a novel. An artist cannot hide from her or his political beliefs; they will be in the work. But to presume that I am smart enough to preach a position runs counter to my artistic sense” (Goyal). Barthes crops up frequently in Everett’s fiction: he appears as “a commedia dell’arte caricature” (Berben-Masi, “Jailhouse” 54) of his real-life self in Glyph (1999), and a parody of his lengthy essay S/Z features prominently in Erasure; but perhaps the most telling use of his ideas appears in Percival Everett by Virgil', '[...].\"1 But in light of more recent critical theory, it is clear that romantic ideas of authority and creative reciprocity go on defending the writing-subject from extinction, at the same time as granting the reader new rights and freedoms. Take, for instance, \"reading after\" (as distinct from \"reading since\") Geoffrey Hart man. While covertly evoking the figure of echo, this activity connotes a range of possible relations between writing and interpretation. If \"after\" plays on hierarchical as well as chronological priority, then reading is imitative creation: voice answered in its own spirit, yet \"with a sound but half its own.\"2 But the transformative potential within echo allows reading to move into a position normally occupied by writing it', 'ses the old idea of the self. Instead of characterizing a failing text as coming “through” a writer, and not “from” him, we must acknowledge that our best writing does, in fact, move through us. In “The Death of the Author,” Roland Barthes says, “[T][...]”(1988, 170). An act of writing is a dance of sources, or appropriated language and concepts, expressing themselves in their combinations and conflicts. And the reader, as Barthes says, “ought at least to know that the inner thing he thinks to translate is itself only a ready-formed dictionary” (170). Thus conceived, the author has multiple selves. He is a unique confluence of other voices, none his own. “It is the language which speaks, not the author” (168). The writer does not invent; he can, as Barthes states, “only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original” (170). Foucault also asserted what he called the “plurality of self” that an author contains, or which contains him or her (1988, 205). When one refers to an author,', 'eges.\"20 Using this transposition one can introduce differences in perspective between the supposed narrator and the character, about whom one will be able to say: \"he did not realize that . ,,\"21 a statement which is difficult to translate into the [...]. Finally, we should now be able to envisage instances in which the potential text is already in historical tenses. The problem then is that of knowing whether we are dealing with a pure narrative or one which combines discourse and history. Some of the above texts exemplify the problems posed by the different ways in which the \"I\"-narrator and the \"I\"-character are expressed. Extension. These effects are dependent upon one last factor, the extension of the use of these figures, that is to say, the relation to context. There are three possible situations: (a) The systematic use of the third person.

(Barthes 1977, 142). 13. See Paul de Man’s remark on the nature of linguistic representation: “To the extent that language is figure (or metaphor, or prosopopeia) it is indeed not the thing itself but the representation, the picture of the thing, and, as such, it is silent, mute as pictures are mute. Language, as a trope, is always privative. (P. de Man 1984, 80) 14. What Edward Said says about the textual representation of the so-called “Orient” may also be treated as an individual variant of the general idea of “crisis of representation”: “It hardly needs to be demonstrated again that language itself is a highly organized and encoded system, which employs many devices to express, indicate, exchange messages and information, represent, ', 'in one\\'s brain; the trilogy is testament to this enduring fascination. Numerous critics have linked writing to occultism, with varying degrees of playfulness. In \"The Death of the Author,\" Roland Barthes suggests that writing itself begins when \"the [...]\" (49). Although Barthes doesn\\'t push this metaphor, it skirts close to what we might term the au delà - literally the beyond , the land of the dead. Beckett is quite willing, where Barthes is not, to engage with these occult associations. Beyond Barthes, Nicholas Royle\\'s Telepathy and Literature has suggested that literature and telepathy are deeply interdependent. As Pamela Thurschwell puts it, the telepathic question par excellence is: whose thoughts are these, inhabiting my inner world (125)? This a question The Unnamable asks with frantic urgency. Telepathy shares with mediumship an inexplicable transference of knowledge and voices, but of the living rather than the dead - and the transferred content often remains internal rather than ', 'n the moderate version) a matter of people “expressing themselves,” but rather, a matter of allowing language to “express itself” through them. Theoretically, Barthes formulates the extreme version of the production argument in the following manner: [...] … . Language knows a “subject,” not a “person,” and this subject, empty outside of the very enunciation which defines it, suffices to make language “hold together.” (Barthes [1967] 1977, 145) Applying this nonsensical theoretical model to actual artistic practice, Barthes outlines the process as follows: The modern scriptor can thus no longer believe, as according to the pathetic view of his predecessors, that this hand is too slow for his thought or passion… . On the contrary, the hand, cut off from any voice, borne by a pure gesture of inscription (and not of expression), traces a field without origin—or which, at least, has no other origin than language itself.

In the moderate version of the production argument, Barthes tries to preserve the concept of intention without the concepts of identity or consciousness.

In the extreme version of the production argument, however, Barthes shifts from concept', 'etical model to actual artistic practice, Barthes outlines the process as follows: The modern scriptor can thus no longer believe, as according to the pathetic view of his predecessors, that this hand is too slow for his thought or passion… .

In the extreme version of the production argument, however, Barthes shifts from concept stealing to package dealing, anthropomorphizing capital-L “Language” and then proceeding to deny that either consciousness or intention are attributable to human beings, thus leaving Language as the on', \"r the course of his essay. Initially, Barthes attempts to disguise the murderous nature of his essay. To prove that he is not committing murder, he attempts to show, on logical grounds, that there simply is no author to be murdered: Did [the author] [...]” he thinks to “translate” is itself only a ready-formed dictionary… . Succeeding the Author, the scriptor no longer bears within him passions, humors, feelings, impressions, but rather this immense dictionary from which he draws a writing that can know no halt. (146–47)16 Barthes's substitution of a “ready-formed dictionary” for the “self” allegedly “expressed” by the author signals the radicalization of a more modest argument of his from Writing Degree Zero. In this early text, Barthes begins from the premise that art has its roots “in the depths of the author's personal and secret mythology” (Barthes [1953] 2012, 10). Unfortunately, Barthes's explication of authorial intention is steeped in mysticism; he alternatively conceives authorial\", \", he attempts to show, on logical grounds, that there simply is no author to be murdered: Did [the author] wish to express himself, he ought at least to know that the inner “thing” he thinks to “translate” is itself only a ready-formed dictionary… .

Unfortunately, Barthes's explication of authorial intention is steeped in mysticism; he alternatively conceives authorial intention as “the writer's ‘thing’” (11), an “occult aspect” of his “carnal structure” that is “locked within [his] body” (12), and a “miracle” of “transmutation” indicating a “supra-literary operation which carries man to the threshold of power and magic” (12\", \"n argument, Barthes resorts in the end to the extreme version of the reception argument. This entails a shift on Barthes's part from speaking of the author being (naturally) succeeded (by the scriptor) to being (forcibly) removed (by the reader): To [...] … [and] when the author has been found, the text is “explained”—victory to the critic… .

Moreover, Barthes goes so far in this passage as to actually assume the role of God. At various points in “The Death of the Author,” Barthes makes references to refusing God and to anti-theological reading practices which reject the “theological” meaning of the Author-God (146–48). By virtue of this passage, however, it is clear that what draws Barthes's wrath is not the con\", 'in his critical \"bricolage\". In any case, the usefulness of theory, for me, has ceased to be about finding the right one or the right combination even, but rather it is about, as a reader of it, the mobility of multiple theoretical positions. What\\'s [...] to me - that it is alright to feel at home nowhere - are recent developments in film and television and recent theories of post-modernism and post-structuralism. Reading then, particularly the kind of reading that involves filling in the gaps, or spanning them, is key to understanding, or understanding that which is not yet understandable: theory or speculation that is no longer religious. Without theory or criticism, film and TV are perhaps incomplete, perhaps inclined to fascism: no more and no less fascist than we are without criticism. The eye sees, then feels, but never finishes the thought. Rather it is seduced into a shallow, pre-emptive understanding. There is only pleasure, without self-recognition, or reorganisation.

About a decade earlier, Joseph haroutunian, translator of Calvin’s Commentaries, made a similar assessment: the so-called literalism of Calvin is directly related to the renaissance scholars’ desire to get at the original and “genuine” meaning of a text (...) so we find Calvin bent upon establishing what a given author in fact said. he criticized the church fathers, especially Augustine, Chrysostom, and Jerome, for dealing too subtly with the texts, for allegorizing and speculation.3 Calvin’s concern for authorship and authorial intention strikes the present author as fair enough. It is the purpose of this study t', 'ical connotation only after the mutual imbrication of bourgeois individualism, professional authorship, and proprietary copyright in the eighteenth century. It was the modern, deified Author (capital “A”) that Roland Barthes sought to demystify. “We [...]’ meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-God), but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash.”2 Writing in Barthes’s immediate wake, Michel Foucault defined authorship exclusively through its function in discourse.3 These famous refusals of an author’s originating power and autonomy remain influential in literary studies. They also helped legitimize book history’s commitment to embedding authors within a “communications circuit,” a “field of cultural production,” or other contingent historical, personal, and economic relationships.4 And yet most book historians believe, contra Barthes and Foucault, that authors (lowercase “a”) play active if not 1. Oxford Latin Dictionary, s.v. “auctor”; ', ' year of 1968, when, at the summit of the high structuralism from which he was soon to descend, Roland Barthes famously declared the \"Death of the Author.\" In this stoically optimistic call for an anti-humanist aes thetics, Barthes observes that \"as [...] (icriture) begins\" (142).1 Further on in the essay, Barthes characterizes the subversive work of this \"6criture,\" which \"ceaselessly posits meaning ceaselessly to evaporate it...\" (147). Barthes enlists the utopian evaporation of meaning in a revolutionary, anti-theological struggle, for as he puts it, \"to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hy postasesreason, science, law\" (147). One can hear Nietzschean echoes in Barthes\\' words, for finally the death of the author amounts to little more than a version of the death of the fabulous Artificer himself, that is, the death of God declared by Nietzsche\\'s Zarathustra a century prior to Barthes\\' essay. In Barthes\\' case, this Nietzschean insistence on the necessarily fugiti', 't of the very practice of the symbol itself, this disconnection occurs, the voice loses its origin, the author enters into his own death, writing (icriture) begins\" (142).1 Further on in the essay, Barthes characterizes the subversive work of this \"6[...] it...\" (147).

One can hear Nietzschean echoes in Barthes\\' words, for finally the death of the author amounts to little more than a version of the death of the fabulous Artificer himself, that is, the death of God declared by Nietzsche\\'s Zarathustra a century prior to Barthes\\' essay. In Barthes\\' case, this Nietzschean insistence on the necessarily fugitive status of both author and meaning ultimately led to the undoing of scientistic structuralism; not surprisingly, under the sign of an ever more ascendant Nietzsche, Barthe', 'signify beyond their intentions. Hence both author and translator are decentered, and the text, whether original or translation, emerges as the uneasy tension of het erogeneous elements that Roland Barthes describes as \"the death of the author\": \"We [...].\"28 Barthes\\'s obituary for the author is important for the theory of translation offered here because the cult of the author in our time, specifically as it is mani fested in the valorization of transparency, has powerfully contributed to the translator\\'s invisibility. If we oppose the prevailing common sense notion that the author expresses himself or a personal truth in the text, we can go some distance toward describing the precise way in which the translator actively produces a determinate object for consumption in the target-language culture. The focus of such a de scription, as my analyses of Graves and Pound suggest, will be the \"tissue of quotations\" that constitute the translation, the often discor dant cultural materials that are', 'y own language [begins] and where it converge[s] with that of others”—an idea itself pla(y)giarized from the poststructuralists, most notably Barthes, who in his notorious “The Death of the Author” (1967) conceives of the text as “a multidimensional [...].” Such pla(y)giarist ecologies have been innovative art’s principle formal tactics for at least the last century, evinced in everything from junk aesthetics (Duchamp’s found art; Kenneth Goldsmith’s uncreative writing) to collage/montage/quotation practices (Braque, Eliot, Burroughs, Michael Graves) and sound sampling/mashup (rock’n’roll, hiphop, industrial and electronic music). Appropriation and manipulation of sf (and myriad other genre) tropes by avantgarde writing is a given, especially for those authors beginning their work in the late 1960s forward—viz., the first generations raised primarily on pop-cultural genres, TV, B-films, and digital modes of entertainment. Many of them also studied philosophy and/or theory as undergraduates ', 'irit of the times demanded this momentary gap in relationship to any kind of given whether it be of a familial or national order. \"The author is therefore undeniably a modern person produced without doubt by the West in as much as, at the end of the [...].\"\\'14 On the other hand, the Haitian writer, like the writer from the Third World, comes to upset the immutable order of traditional society where knowledge is still accumulated in the form of collective wisdom. The gods standing at the summit of group history govern all knowledge. The irruption of the peculiar figure of the writer threatens the relative immunity of society with the uniqueness of his individual word. An immunity maintained in large part by the repetition of the same, drawn from popular 741 \\n L CALLALOG _ _ _ _ wisdom. The writer in the context of our traditional society appears then as a strange, misunderstood, useless and even dangerous figure. Misunderstood even by his potential readers, the well-read ones who, if they en', \"s might dismiss the relevance of playing this supposedly long-dead music.'45 Defending his creative practices, Roberts invokes Roland Barthes' assertion in The Death of the Author that 'the responsibility for a narrative is never \\n 408 BRIAN W. NAIL [...].46 Consequently, Roberts compares his 'subtle reor de-formation of the songs in individual performances to the way years of footsteps gradually and imperceptibly wear down and remould a staircase'.47 Instead of exercising a dogmatic fidelity to the original or seeking to claim some originality as a songwriter, Roberts, like Amidon, creates his work in the spirit of the trad ition from which his music is derived in the hope of transmitting songs from one era to the next. In doing so, the traces of the voices of the past are passed on to an unknown future. The survival of these songs—and the notions of the sacred they convey—depends like the well-worn staircase, upon their malleability. III. TWO WAYS OF LISTENING So far I have highlighted th\", '\\'s Latinist performs an action described by Roland Barthes in \"The Death of the Author,\" the landmark 1968 essay that more or less set the terms of subsequent debate in these matters, and to which Foucault \\'s essay, in particular, is a response: \"To [...].\"8 In his engagements with Catullus \\'s poem, Frost himself remains more or less open or \"agnostic\": he is not quite sure how to manage the proliferating possibilities of meaning in the poem. He asks - as in the sonnet \"Design,\" which treats a related philosophical theme - \"if design govern in a thing so small\" (emphasis added): \"I rather think Catullus hadn\\'t thought it all out.\" Of course, neither Frost\\'s rather vague version of Catullus nor the Latinist \\'s rather more clarified version is unequivocally \"present\" in the poem. Catullus \\'s \\n Believing in Robert Frost 449 consciousness, intention and design - traditional attributes of \"authorship\" according to Foucault \\'s analysis - are instead the \"psychologizing\" projection of readers more', 'wn from the \"innumerable centres of culture\" (Barthes 146), the fragments of little dialogues heard on the street accrete until the book, even if at times it plays like the work of one person, exemplifies and manifests a conception of the text as a \"[...]\" (Barthes 146). \"[T]he voice,\" as had been predicted, \"loses its origin\" (Barthes 142). Moreover, the frequent use of linguistic shifters further confuses the identity of voices so that even when a clause such as \"She ate her pudding in a pattern\" follows \"My mother\\'s childhood seemed a kind of holy melodrama\" (16), the reader cannot be sure to whom the \"she\" refers. Indeed, the indeterminate text leaves the reader unable even to conclude whether \"My mother\" refers to Hejinian, her mother, her grandmother, or some other person. As in much of John Ashbery\\'s writing, pronouns-grammatical elements that are already once displaced from the proper name of the \"real\" subject-slip and shift through My Life until the object of their linguistic poin', 'tributed to authors and allows for the flow of influence from sources outside the author’s consciousness.98 Barthes’s scriptor possesses an ‘immense dictionary’ of material on which to draw, much of it absorbed through reading.

This 'literature of exhaustion7, so termed by John Barth in his essay of the same name, wherein existing modes of literary representation have been exhausted of creative possibility, seems to find an echo in discussions of sampling practice (Barth 1967). This makes it tempting to imagine sampling as the ultimate postmodern exercise, the soundtrack to the Author-God's death scene. Much of the theoretical discourse generated around sampling practice uses existing literary and visual art to project a legible aesthetic paradigm onto the song-as-collage. Marcel Duchamp's moustachioed Mona Lisa, Wil\", ' manifestly, the impossible sentence I am writing’’ (Discourse 334). Similarly, Roland Barthes has linked ‘‘The Death of the Author’’ to the writings of Mallarmé and French symbolism in particular, and thus implicitly supports Kittler’s analysis: ‘‘[...] I’’ (‘‘Death of the Author’’ 145). Contrary to Kittler and Barthes, however, most critics still focus on the fundamental ‘‘Epochenverwandtschaft’’ (WalterMüller-Seidel) between the two time periods.1 They identify the birth of the modern episteme, to use Foucault’s terminology, with the rise of Romanticism and thus tend to emphasize its similarities rather than its differences with literary modernism around 1900. Foucault himself dates the beginning of what he calls ‘‘literature’’ proper at the beginning of the nineteenth century, at which time language ceases to function as the self-effacing mediator between everything else and ‘‘acquires a being of its own’’ (Order of Things 360).

With looks, gestures, and movement, with voices, sighs, and sounds, with promises, words and stories. Seduction is not any one thing said, seen, or done, but a whole elaborately joined set of scenes containing movement, sounds, and gestures. Yet in our society, as in all societies, the sights and sounds of seduction are far from random. Rather seductions occur through culturally proscribed codes. Gestures or promises must occur in a certain order, follow a prescribed form, certain language must be used, or the seduction will not succeed. A seducer, above all, must persuade his audience; if not, there is no seduction. Hence both the content of the cultural code that he employs and how he evokes it must h', 'eir sensibility. In his newly-written conclusion, \"The Notion of a Sacred Text,\" the text dissolves into the reader, who becomes \"a living texture of ideas derived from . . . reading* (p. 132). One is reminded of Roland Barthes\\' famous epigram, \"the [...]* (Image - Music - Text [N.Y.: Hill and Wang, 1977], p. 148). Community can be created through the sharing of these private realities (\"textual fragments\"), each of which \"will inevitably rescue a different sense from Sinai.\" And one might imagine the construction of Reality itself through the \"transcendental convergence of all interpretations\" (pp. 132-33). But it cannot be, because, finally, the Bible deconstructs itself. The Bible\\'s \"humanly conditioned divine voice,\" which is the key to its interpretability, also condemns it to the prison-house of language. Therefore, Fishbane argues, \"the ultimate sacral possibility of the Bible may ... lie in teaching that God\\'s truth transcends all linguistic pretensions to meaning* (p. 133). Fishban', 'ing among its practitioners about the importance of intentionality, humanistic formal- \\n Humanistic Formalism 5 ism recognizes the folly of the effort to deconstruct the author. Thus it questions Culler\\'s assertion that, \"If, as Barthes claims, \\'the [...],\\' many have been willing to pay that price.\"7 I wonder if anyone who has tried to teach Ulysses without having read Joyce\\'s prior work or Ellmann\\'s biography could subscribe to such a view. Put baldly, does not a work readily yield a more determinate meaning to those readers who know about the author\\'s other texts, life, and historical context? A revitalized humanistic criticism would discard such New Critical orthodoxies as the biographical fallacy and the shibboleth \"exit author\" and discover how to speak of the author as a formal presence in the text in ways that go beyond equating the omniscient narrator or implied author with the biographical author. For we need an aesthetic that takes account of how, particularly in such modern texts', ' is a function not of any straightforward correspondence between signifier and signified, but of a complex set of phonetic and conceptual differences. Later the French critic Roland Barthes pointed out that each text is a tissue of quotations: not a [...]\" meaning of an author-god but a multidimensional space where a variety of writings blend and/or clash. Today Jacques Derrida argues that the meaning of such a multidimensional space can never be completely fulfilled, for the continual circulation of signifiers denies meaning any fixed foundation or conclusion. Hence texts never attain self-presence, and that includes the text that constitutes me. What would happen if these claims about textuality were extrapolated into claims about the whole universe? A metaphor for such cosmic interpenetration and lack of self-presence is found in the Avatamsaka Sutra of Mahayana Buddhism: Indra\\'s Net. Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net that has been hung by so', 'ship for less than half the price.) Nevertheless, Foucault\\'s words posited a stand in sharp contrast to that of Roland Barthes, whose even more celebrated essay on \"The Death of the Author\" had been published just the year before. Barthes had said: \"[...]\" (171). On the contrary, Foucault suggested new avenues of approach: \"What are the modes of existence of this discourse? Where has it been used, how can it circulate, and who can appropriate it for himself?\" and so forth (210). Such questions can be fruitful for practicing critics, inviting them not to give up on the task of elucidation, but to relate text and context in a new way: they are encouraged not (as in past historical approaches) to consider a given work \"against\" any fixed biographical and social \"background,\" but instead to see it as an arena for crosscurrents in the intellectual (more specifically, ideological) flux of its day. In other words, if authors have vanished from academic sight as unique personalities, swamped by all', 'y be regarded as an ideological casualty of the wars of theory, which go under the rubric \"poststructuralism,\" in which the profession has been engaged since the late 1960s. Writing in 1968, Roland Barthes was able to say, with some complacency: \"We [...]\" (\"The Death of the Author\").34 This essay is not the place to survey the consequences of post-structuralism for the analysis of literary texts. Nor ought one to project the trajectory of one\\'s own career onto the profession at large. I have students and colleagues who find the new poststructuralist dispensation eman cipatory. For them, like Barthes (I again quote from \"The Death of the Author\"), \"literature ... by refusing to assign a \\'secret\\', an ultimate meaning, to the text (and to the world as text) liberates what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity that is truly revolutionary since to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his 3?

For them, like Barthes (I again quote from \"The Death of the Author\"), \"literature ... by [...]\" (147). Those who defend the authority of canonical texts are accused of defending as well the institutional authority and status of those who teach those texts, incurring thereby the charge of self-interest?however much we may feel that, like Hooker, what we are defending is precisely that \"reason, science [in the sense of objective knowledge], law\" that Barthes is so happy to be liberated from. Still, whichever side one chooses, there is little doubt that the older world of text as displaced Scripture has largely vanished. An epoch has come to an end, in our lifetimes, and we are its witnesses. The history of literature\\'s declining authority and status that Kernan recounts matches my own experience with painful accuracy, although the pai', 'rpretive process consists in fabricating meaning. As roland Barthes famously put it in his essay “The death of the Author”: “. . . A text consists of multiple writings, issuing from several cultures and entering into a dialogue with each other, into [...] is \\n 64 reseArch iN AFricAN literAtures Volume 49 Number 3 collected, united, and this place is not the author, as we have hitherto said it was, but the reader . . .” (12). Barthes’s essay surely could not have escaped the attention of Taïa, whose narrator in Le Rouge du Tarbouche expresses his admiration for Barthes (57). The readers’ interpretative work can be frustrated due to their unfamiliarity with Moroccan cultural practices such as the royal hand kiss. in real life, the doors of the king’s palace were open to everybody, as the monarch was accustomed to say. When he visited with his subjects, the obligatory hand kiss (baise-main)—a symbol of allegiance and submission—took on a highly symbolic value (Abdallah Laroui 25). indeed, the', 'th in question is not in fact a death at all. It does not belong to the realm of limitation, finality, and closure. Instead, it proclaims the openness and open-endedness of the critical mode that Barthes’s essay envisions. Barthes argues that ‘‘[t]o [...],’’5 and that to remove this author is to open up the text to on-going exegesis. It is hence the very entity whose removal the essay proposes that is rhetorically aligned with manifestations of metaphorical death (limit, telos, completion). Consequently, the death of the author, announced in the essay’s title, becomes the death of death itself: It is the origin, and the symbol, of the properly deathless text. In view of such topical reverberations, any detective will be simultaneously exhilarated and embarrassed by the emergence of this particular textual echo, for it represents a solution too good to be true. Joyce’s sentence does not—cannot—refer to Barthes’s article published twenty-six years after Joyce’s death. Any number of explanatio', \"earlier referred to has a predominance of imperfect tense verbs.

Even the employment of the verb 'recuerdo' to refer to events that occurred 'hace un rato' [a while ago] suggests a radical discontinuity between moments of time that are near to each other, as though the feat of remembrance in this case were considerable. Paradoxically, Eladio's recollection of an episode with a prostitute which begins in the past tense becomes most vividly realized when he switches suddenly to the present tense, converting the past into a constantly remembered present: 'veo nada m?s que el hombro irritado por las barbas' (p. 8) [I can only see the shoulder reddened by the bear\", 'ntext.

Barthes\\'s essay, we should remember, notes that the death of the author is accompanied by the birth of the reader. For Barthes, the importance placed on the author by modern society is related to a post-Enlightenment stress on \"the [...]\" (143). In analysis of literary texts the author is thus conceived of as a figure already fully formed prior to the writing of the literary text, who \"exists before it, thinks, suffers, lives for it, is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his child\" (145). Modernist writers such as Proust in In Search of Lost Time, Barthes suggests, question this formulation. \"By a radical reversal,\" Barthes argues of Proust, \"instead of putting his life into his novel, as is so of ten maintained, he made of his very life a work for which his own book was the model\" (144). Much recent work on autobiography, notably that by Paul John Eakin, has made a parallel point. Post-Enlightenment societies place a stress on the uniqueness of', 'the origin of the text, the source of its meaning, and the only authority for interpretation. The author thus needs to be liberated from the metaphysical status and reduced to a \"location.\" Once the author is removed from the traditional status, the [...]\" (Barthes, \"Death\" 147). Vizenor defies this closure; he is on the side of the liberation and diversity of meaning. The reader is in this sense also liberated, in Barthesian terminology: \"It is the birth of the reader at the cost of the death of the author\" (148). Hence the reader is free to enter the text from any direction; there is no correct or prescribed route. \\n Kerstin Schmidt 69 As Vizenor describes it: \"The author cedes the landscape to the reader and then dies, the narrators bear the scheme, bodies are wild, and the trickster liberates the mind in comic discourse\" (Trickster xi).

More to the point, Barthes’ theory, partly articulated in the title of his essay, rejects the cult of authorship promoted by writers like Wordsworth in favour of an understanding of creative production as a networked, relational activity. Clearly, I f ind Barthes’ poststructuralist spin on creative production more convincing than Wordsworth’s Romantic meditation on spontaneous overflows. My interest,', 'ng is deliberate. Whether the scholar sees the genial Trollope seated comfortably in the text, or the irascible Flaubert skulking angrily behind his, critics continue to \"tyranically center,\" as Barthes puts it, \"the image of literature on . . . the [...] . . .\" but they have reached their quarry by different routes: content in the first case, style in the second. Of course, Trollope\\' s tone tells a tale as well as Nabokov\\'s does, but Nabokov\\'s arrogance is formal, relational, and his control is not that of a fatherly Czar but that of the secret police. The performative \"I declare,\" \"I sing,\" \"I write,\" does not, in fact, cut the text off at the point of the pen, as Barthes seems to think. Nabokov\\'s passage is a performance . . . and a good one. In this sense, Trollope\\' s touch could only dull the master\\'s quill.

The cinematic concept serves as the instrument that brings “happiness” to the writer, “surprising” himself and us, as he invites us into the experience of world-making. If, as Peter Wollen describes Godard’s auteurist cinema as “a process of writing in images, rather than a representation of the world,” then recent twenty-first-century gay auteurs such as Castro rehearse New Wave écriture to the extent that they infuse their cineaste elders’ aesthetics with seductive homosexuality, one haunted by the shadow of AIDS.

Similar to Bouvard and Pecuchet, those eternal copyists, at once sublime and comic and whose profound ridiculousness indicates precisely the truth of writing, the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original. His only power is to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others, in such a way as never to rest on any one of them.

(\"Death\" 146) Fowles\\' narrator openly reminds us that he is writing in the age of textuality, noting that \"I live in the age of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Roland Barthes\" (80). The work of Barthes is one of the many intertexts that plays constantly in the margins of The French Lieutenant\\'s Woman. Thus Sarah, though an authorial figure, is herself constituted by the literature that she has read and by the fantasies of Charles (and of Fowles\\' narrator, and-for that matter-of the reader). She does not create her narratives ex nihilo, but instead \"mixes writings, countering the ones with others.\" Indeed, Fowles\\' self-consciously intertextual book seems to present itself (like Bouvard and Pecuchet) as an explicit demonstration ', \"thus for the second level of intervention, as outlined above. For the assumption seems to be that either meaning is determined by the author, or it is determined by the reader. It is in this spirit that Roland Barthes announced, in 1968, that '[t]he [...] of the author' (1977:148). From statements such as these it would appear that no intermediary position is possible. Making the text the reader's text, however potentially, brings with it the pitfall of unconstrained interpretation. If a reader can read anything he or she likes into a text, then the interpretation on which the ethical intervention is based is worse than worthless. It is also unethical in the same way as it is unethical wilfully to misinterpret a person's words. As Hogan has pointed out, it is necessary to distinguish between interpretation and the political ends for which it may be used. Political interpretation rests in part on a decision to act politically. The truth-claims of the interpretation however, must be independe\", 'a and both refer to fictions. Merino eschews both labels since he purports to be writing non-fiction in the second part. Moreover, Merino’s refusal to include a message in the novel follows Barthes’ exhortation that writing should refuse to give “a ‘[...]),” for in so doing, it will liberate the text from having to conform to “reason, science, [and] law” – an activity that Barthes characterizes as “anti-theological” (117). The lack of a message in a communicative act breaks the “buena ley de arte” referenced by dramatized author Unamuno in Niebla, though it does maintain a sense of mystery. nevertheless, what Merino seeks to control as carefully as Unamuno in becoming his own critic also escapes his control, for readers will find a message to his novel, such as the importance of the people, ideas, and processes – i.e., of the creation of fiction to which readers are rarely privy – of existence, of ordering our world, and of creating an identity through art. The message for the community of ', 'he obsession with the author should give way to the rise of the reader—which must necessarily culminate in the author’s death (1469-1470). For Barthes, removing the author equates to interpretative liberation, since conflating author and text “is to [...]” (1469). Neo- Victorianism’s fixation on fleshing out authors’ lives via text necessarily complicates Barthes’s objectives. Revivifying the dead is foundational to the neo-Victorian novel, which is in essence an amalgamation of past and present, and literal and figurative. As such, Andrea Kirchknopf describes Barthes’s treatise as “gradually...fading away” (49) while Cora Kaplan perceives it as potentially reinvigorating the authorial persona, in that [t]he healthy demand for Victorian literary biography and biofiction suggests either that the death of the author, the disappearance and dispossession of what Barthes called ‘his civil status, his biographical person’ has been greatly exaggerated, or, conversely, that the threat has breathed ', 'that all the text(s) were pressed simultaneously)? Is the origin mark that precedes or proceeds a displacement, a permutation? A subsitution? A secret key? A red herring? A form of the library is incomplete without authors and readers-or is it? \"The [...]\" (Barthes 148). This is one of the means in which we trump the final signified and delimit interpretations. It is in the next codeme where we will open up the typology of these newborn readers... Codeme 10: The library itself is a (non)living, (non)breathing ex ample of an aporia...A polyglot of Gongorian interpretations, a polyamorous style of reading. But to call it an aporia is to ascribe a determinate meaning, even if the term itself denotes the impossibil ity of meaning (the paradox of naming). What we do know is that the library is the source of the fundamental problem, the aporia the librarians have attempted to overcome. Borges depicts the history of the librarian\\'s comportment toward text(s) in a way that partially mimics the hist', \"meaning words acquire in their poetic context, independently of their 'everyday' meaning. With the work of Roland Barthes meaning is further questioned and dismissed as stable or independent from the text. In 'The Death of the Author' he writes: 'In [...], to the text... liberates what may be called an anti theological activity, an activity that is truly revolutionary since to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases—reason, science, law'.49 The literary, according to Barthes, refuses the fixed, metaphys ical God. My argument is that this is not a mere secular tum, but rather the opening of a different, anti-theological religiosity that is linked, moreover, to literature. In 'Des Tours de Babel' Derrida seems to suggest that the literary and the sacred have a 'common root'. Referring to a translation's lack of content and its 're-marking the affinity among the languages', he says: 'And that, which holds for the literary text or the sacred text, perhaps defines \", 'ting a text but is unavailable for interpreting it. But whereas Foucault a year later would offer fresh proposals for the text itself as the source of meaning, Barthes locates meaning in the reader: \\n The Dialogic Function of Composition Pedagogy 55 [...]. (129) And that reader, Barthes declares, is without history; he or she can only be described in terms of the person reading at the moment of reading, not in terms of that reader as a collective or unified, transtemporal subject. Foucault, too, attests the death of the author: “It is obviously insufficient to repeat empty slogans: the author has disappeared; God and man died a common death” (Barthes 121). His essay “What Is an Author?” focuses on the name of the author and how readers construct from the text an “author” that may have little or nothing to do with the person who composed the text. An author’s name differs from other proper names in that it functions as a means of classifying texts and establishing relationships among them: a', 'm but also of the reader, and his relation to phantom traces of past life manipulated by some brain is a figure for our relation to Bulwer-Lytton\\'s text. In Barthesian terms, the reader \"is only that someone who holds collected into one and the same [...] is constituted\" (\"The Death of the Author\" 54). At the second level of analogy, the quantitatively ambiguous \"the haunted\" can be taken as the class of readers. We hear twice that \"no two persons . .. ever told [the landlord: bookseller, library owner, publisher?] that they experienced exacdy the same thing\" (109). The equivocating word \"exacdy\" here allows us to situate this difference in terms of reader response theory or in the stronger sense of the \"plural\" or even \"writerly\" text in Barthes. But, at this second level of analysis these different experiences of tele pathically triggered impressions, sensations, images, and associations, which nonetheless apparendy share at least a family resemblance, also encode a set or class of texts ', \"of the author that lends the text its authority, nor does it involve the theory of egotistical sublimity wrongly associated with romanticism, in which that authority derives from the massive presence of the author. But he also does not argue for the [...] and written by its decentered processes . There is for him a dialectical tension be\\xad tween author and text, in which the text assumes a degree of autonomy, but in which the writer, too, must take a stand (or a series of stands) outside these differences that never seem to progress toward identities. Such, for instance, is the tension in Blake's Songs between a series of poems that endlessly displace and rewrite each other, and the voice of the bard, which in some sense clearly does represent 'Blake' himself, but without making Blake present to us. This demand that the authors declare themselves is explored more fully in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Against the attempts in phil\\xad osophical and religious hermeneutics to establish t\", 'e idea of literature.

Rewriting as a Creative Adaptationt The hermeneutics implicit in al-Dīb’s rewriting can be described through the interplay between two closely related strategies: intertextuality and parody. Al-Dīb undertakes numerous alterations and insinuations and opens space for a profound dialogue between Ḥāsib and the Serpent Queen. These “falsities” and displacements, as Borges calls them (Obras 1:473), create the potential for new and unexpected meanings. As a result, al-Dīb’s hypertext reveals a hybrid nature and a ploy to transform the original and turn it into a personal history, a vita of a Ṣūfī on his journey toward love. However, Bulūqiyā’s journey and respectively that of Ḥāsib carry the ṣifa (quality) of love an', 'sly challenged by developments in the fields of sociology, film studies, and linguistics, where debates on authorship have arisen. These critiques have questioned the centrality of the author as a fixed point of meaning. As Roland Barthes put it, \"A [...] . .. the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the author. \"36 The centrality of the designer as the person who determines meaning in design is undermined by the complex nature of design development, production, and consumption, a process involving numerous people who precede the act of production, others who mediate between production and consumption, and those who use the design. The success or failure of a designer\\'s initial concept depends on the existence of agencies and organizations which can facilitate the development, manufacture, and retailing of a specific design for a distinct market. Design, then, is a collective process; its meaning can only be determined by an examination of the interaction of individuals, ', 'iniscent of Roland Barthes\\'s essay, \"The Death of the Author\" (1968), whose title in turn echoes Nietzsche\\'s \"death of God.\" For Barthes, the removal of the author from the production of meaning and the resulting textual resistance to closure is an \"[...] and his hypostasesreason, science, law\" (212). What one finds in Bergman\\'s films is a growing unease with the narrative manifestations of these hypostases. It should come as no surprise, considering Bergman\\'s oft-noted artistic affinity for the female character, that the narrative crisis emerging from the rejection of God appears in the films in terms of sexual difference. Bergman\\'s increasing preoccupation with the feminine can be seen as a search for alternative discourse that avoids the religious and authoritarian implications of narration by a male. It is as if \"maleness,\" in particular the authoritative male voice, is made to carry the burden of Bergman\\'s struggles with God. Masculine discourse in Bergman\\'s scheme resonates with undes', '; Watkins, 1992; Yeoman, 1995).

The idea is partly that as soon as authors engage in \"writ ing\"-as opposed to \"speaking\"-they have divorced themselves from their own \"voice,\" and find themselves involved in this laby rinth of intertextuality and slippage and a lot of other stuff.

Whereas Barthes will argue that it is only and precisely to the extent that \"the [...]\" (49), Adorno\\'s emphasis on the \"formal law\" of late style, as I argue above, remains invested in a dialectic in which death-as-limit returns as \"catastrophe.\" 18. See, for example, Adorno\\'s argument in Beethoven, where individual death in its \"insignificance\" is linked to the unfreedom of the subject within the dialectic. \"The ideas set down here need to be related to the Hegelian notion of bad individuality, the conception that only the universal is substantial. The purpose of the fractured quality of the late Beethoven would then be to express the fact that such substantiality of the universal represents alienation, violence, privation-that is, it does not raise the individual to a higher level. Beethoven becomes \\'inorganic,\\' fractured,', 'quent writings (and life \\n THE STYLING BODY IN MODERN JAPANESE LITERATURE / 467 conduct) conform to the image of the personae they had created\" (Gerbert, Introduction 8-9). The Proust that fascinated Barthes meets the Japanese writ ers midway: \"By a [...]\" (\"The Death of the Author\" 144). This convergence of life and text demands more than a critique of biographism, essentialism, or humanism. If whatever radicality was harbored by shishosetsu finally culminated in literary pro vincialism and critical naivete, or transpired only as an anxiety whose work was always to suture, it did so on account of the notion of mimesis undergirding a particular practice of history. Michael Bourdaghs, for example, delineates the shifting reception of Shima zaki Toson, a representative shishosetsu author, within the history of modern Japa nese literary criticism, highlighting the ideological appropriation of the (auto) biographical figure of the author for historical expediencies (chap. 1).

Here the macro and the micro, the archive and the manuscript, both risk revision; liberation; and, DeLillo seems to suggest, their very mooring onto meaning. It is the return of the death of the author, replaced by what Barthes calls a “[...],” neither “preceding” nor “exceeding” it (145). Perhaps this is the danger of the digital for DeLillo but also its lure? Perhaps this is why Bill Gray must literally die toward the end of Mao II, because he refuses to die symbolically? 1997 “The reason I use a manual typewriter,” DeLillo writes in a letter to David Foster Wallace in 1997, “concerns the sculptural quality I find in words on paper, the architecture of the letters individually and in combination, a sensation advanced (for me) by the mechanical nature of the process— finger striking key, hammer striking page.

The “prestige of the individual” was such that, in each case, it authorized the future text and authored the past. The readerly commentary was the death of textual potentialities.

As an event in history, literature\\'s value lies for Barthes in its invention of a \"voice\" that, in the action of recounting, no longer speaks \"with a [...]\" (\"Death\" 142). In aspiring to \"find again the freshness of a pristine state of language\" beyond referentiality, Barthes in effect envisions a poststructuralist encounter with the limit of speech - utterances that don\\'t have anything to say ( Writing 74). Barthes is essentially a modernist aesthete who, as Susan Sontag noted long ago, locates \"the writer\\'s zone of freedom\" in his or her making \"literature into a fundamentally problematic activity.\"4 Such an author is obviously still quite lively. Yet from reading Ryan\\'s account, one would hardly guess that Barthes harbors this quasi-poststructuralist commitment to literary nonreferentiality. To be sure, Ryan notes Barthes\\'s interest in \"shift[ing] attention to writing as such\" (26); but th', '\\'the author\\' is used to order the field of Old Javanese \\'texts\\' (which, in turn, are deployed to order the field of \\'manuscripts\\'). Yet, despite its apparent ubiquity, \\'the author\\' is a concept with a history. According to Barthes (1977:142-3), \\'the [...]\". Taken together, the pervasiveness and the historical specificity of \\'the author\\' should be cause for consideration. 44 Elsewhere Robson (1983:292) remarked, \\'if we may assume that a poem is something meant to be enjoyed, something meant to give pleasure to its audience, then we are obliged to ask how the poet set about the task and how he imagined he would achieve his aim\\'. The facile invocation of pleasure, in this connection, should give some cause for consideration. Roland Barthes (1973), for example, dedicated an entire essay to Le plaisir du texte. On what basis is one to assume the commensurability of contemporary western notions of \\'pleasure\\' with those of ancient Java? Here, Robson\\'s caution (1983:292) regarding the imposition of', 'is sourceless (\"atmospheric\") signification. The use of biography here, as elsewhere, amounts to an institutionalized rejection of the signifier.42 Even at a mass, (so to speak) Hollywood level, painting is thought of as centered on the artist , his [...]; and the Watteau literature, faithful to this conception of the artist, confirms the view that biography is the image\\'s natural explanation.

The reader, protagonist, and eventual author of Volver a casa, may well succeed in taking the place of the modern scriptor, but his pursuit of a self-affirming identity as an all-knowing \"Author\" is doomed to fail. Identity, like life, is also a tissue of signs, an imitation of becoming that is continuously being lost and replaced, and, in the final analysis, is infinitely deferred. VI.

The famous ‹nal clause—“the [...]” (Barthes 1977, 148)—sounds almost callous, therefore. But this is because, for Barthes, the ‹gures of the author and the reader are standing in for different orders of discourse that, in a somewhat polemical way, are being starkly opposed: the Author (with a capital A) stands for an ideology of communication in which agents are at least partly autonomous, and the Author’s opposite number is not the reader, therefore, but the Critic (we are being referred to Barthes’s polemic in the 1960s against “University criticism” and in favor of the French nouvelle critique). The reader, on the other hand, who goes uncapitalized, refers us to a concept of writerliness, or textuality, that is described in this essay as “originless” (its “scriptor” is ', 'e.

But if we read that essay more carefully, we find that the reader is something very abstract for Barthes, something which cannot be personal, which is “innumerable centres of culture,” which is a nonindividualized generator, and which is [...]. Barthes’s reader therefore has features chiefly based on the principle liberating meaning from the text and activating its field of significance, and is a matter of process and of the infinity of possibilities for realizing the meaning of the literary work. According to him, meaning becomes action. What in fact has been liberated is the text—and its semantic field. And the unique experience of the reader has been cut short. From another point of view it is possible to take this act of liberation of Barthes as a disavowal of the traditional mimetic process that unites text and author (in the coordinates of the theory of reflection2) and thus determines the competences of the reader. This disavowal, however, brings Barthes to the opposite p', \"t; the idea of subjectivity or sense of self as, for example, feeling feminine-being a feminist 11. Most famously rendered in Barthes's essay 'The Death of the Author' (1977). Barthes asks the origin of the voice of a character in Balzac's prose: We [...]. (p. 142) 12. Subjectify, meaning 'make subject (to)', always carries a negative charge in deconstruction or poststructuralist thinking. But, of course, the issue of how we can do politics without subjects remains (Squires, 1993). 13. Foucault used the notion of archaeology initially to conceptualise his research into the 'historical a priori on which certain forms of knowledge become possible'.

In her loneliness after Malcolm\\'s departure, she \"was writing [poetry] more copiously, more fluently, than ... ever ... before,\" and she uses an image for her writing uncannily like one of Cixous\\'s--\"the ink was pouring on to the sheets like blood\" (p. 115; cf. \"The Laugh of the Medusa,\" p. 261). After James, she stops writing because, as she says, \"I did not know how to write about joy, I could find no words, no patterns for the damp and intimate secrets of love\" (p. 115); but then James\\'s accident inspires \"a very good sequence of poems\" (p. 250). Jane\\'s fiction, ho', 's El, for instance, one finds another dimension at play: the autobiographical. Who is El? Writing, claimed Roland Barthes?and here I would add creating?\"is that neuter, that composite, that obliquity into which our subject flees, the black-and-white [...] that writes\" (149). Since post-structuralists claimed the death of the author, many critics have been willing to rethink, in particular, biogra? phy\\'s confrontation with fiction. Critics have shied away from Bu?uel\\'s memoirs, losing the opportunity to tease out many of the ambiguities inherent in his work. As many scholars theoriz? ing on the issue of autobiography and memoirs have shown, to acknowledge this body of writing takes us beyond the simplistic correlation of truth often assigned to the genre (the work of Philippe Lejeune and his research group is particularly relevant for this line of inquiry.

This article examines the way in which the basic structure and the structural change of allegory presents responses to historical pr', ' heart of language. A matter of compensa tion when faced with the injustices of language, literature carries the promise of a neutral writing. It is something often overlooked by readers of Barthes\\'s now-monumental essay, \"The Death of the Author\": \"[...] through which our subject escapes . . .\" [49]. Barthes dreamed of writing a novel, the neutral novel. Perhaps appropriately, the project was never completed. A matter of weariness. The time of the neutral novel is that of postponement. Where does one look for the neutral? We enter a fragile archive, a formless filing cab inet: Blanchot (\"except for certain philosophers and for Blanchot... the Neutral has had a bad press\" [69]); Pyrrho and the Skeptics (\"historically, the \\'official\\' space of the neu tral is Skepticism\" [72]); Eastern philosophies and mysticisms; Baudelaire (of Artificial Paradise); Rousseau, Benjamin, Pasolini, Cage. Disciplinarity is out of the question since the neutral crosses language, gesture, affect, action, the body,', 'porary (post-1970) discourse. Like Tolkien himself, Barthes grounds his conception of the author in an analogy between the author and the divine. He points out that, throughout history, the image of literature has been \"tyrannically centered\" on the [...]\" (143). Yet Barthes is not content to define the author as mere celebrity or royalty: he must elevate the author to divine status. From the essay\\'s title, which alludes to Nietzsche\\'s earlier pronouncement of the death of God, to the \"Author-God\" whom he invokes, Barthes is at pains to establish an ongoing analogy that draws upon the attributes of the divine. As Sean Burke explains, for Barthes, \"The author is to his text as God [...] is to his world: the unitary cause, source and master to whom the chain of textual effects must be traced, and in whom they find their genesis, meaning, goal and justification\" (23). Just as the natural theologian searches for traces of God in nature or from design, so too is the text the site from which evid', 'the fragmented dispersions of meaning within a text and moving, referentially, to the ultimate meaning that inheres with the Author-God. The presence of the author has crucial implications when it comes to the possibility of apprehending meaning: To [...]. (147) Barthes\\'s comments establish, on the one hand, not only the author\\'s privileged position but also the privileged position of the critic, whose ability to \"explain\" the text endows him or her with authoritative status. On the other hand, the author becomes the gateway to meaning, the \"impose[d] limit\" that shuts out any possibility for unfettered interpretation. For Barthes, the presence of an 48 SO Mythlore 121/122, Spring/Summer 2013 \\n Benjamin Saxton author that grounds the text within a finite set of meanings is a misguided imposition that must be corrected. The text, he writes, \"is not a line of words releasing a single \\'theological\\' meaning (the \\'message\\' of the Author-God) but a multidimensional space in which a variety of wri', 'ader is no longer obligated to trace meaning back to its originary source. Indeed, \"once the Author is removed, the claim to decipher a text becomes quite futile\" (Barthes 147). Barthes acknowledges and embraces the anti-theological implications: In [...]. (147) The analogy between author and God reaches its conclusion: following the death of God is now the death of the author and, with it, a vast expansion of interpretive possibilities. Throughout his theological analogy, Barthes assumes that domination follows naturally from God\\'s omnipotence and omnipresence and, secondly, that the author retains this omnipotence when he constructs a text. Barthes thus reacts strongly against an Author-God that dominates, appropriates, and denies alternative interpretations: \"the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author\" (148). However, as Burke points out, it is not necessary to accept the relationship between author and God solely on Barthes\\' terms: The attributes of omnipoten', 'at is more, Xiao Shao\\'s (or Chu\\'s) decision to shroud Barthes\\'s name in anonymity should remind us that Barthes\\'s account of intertextuality also involves the loss of identity and the death of the author. For Barthes, to write is to be lost in \"that [...]\" ( Image-Music-Text 142). A writer can never \"express\" himself/herself, because what is produced is always a \"ready-formed dictionary, its words only explainable through other words, and so on indefinitely\" ( Image-Music-Text 146). Moreover, \"As institution, the author is dead: his civil status, his biographical person have disappeared\" ( Pleasure of the Text 27). Chu, however, seems eager to subscribe to an expressive and autobiographical reading of her text (see her interview with Jang Chi-jiang), so perhaps the exorcism/excision of Barthes\\'s name is a ritual to ensure the death of his theories. Indeed, as I have noted, Chu responds in Hua yi qianshen to Ng Kim Chew\\'s reading of Huangren shouji as a tribute to her teacher Hu Lancheng wit', 'ital. Finally, Roland Barthess proclamation of the \"death of the author\" strikes a blow not only against the presumed authority of the writer, but also against the presumed autonomy of a literary work. Barthes argues that, in a postmodern world, the [...]\" (146). Consequently, adaptation must be seen not as a one-way, hierarchical relationship between literature and film, but rather as what Robert Stam calls a \"multileveled negotiation of intertexts\" (67) in which books and movies are \"caught up in the ongoing whirl of intertextual reference and transformation, of texts generating other texts in an endless process of recycling, transformation, and transmutation, with no clear point of origin\" (66). Several of the essays selected for inclusion here embrace and build upon this distinctly postmodern view of adaptation. In his analysis of Tim Burton\\'s recent adaptation of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Brian Patrick Riley argues that rather than getting \"mired in conside', 'annical proclamations but in the reader who \"is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed without any of them being lost; a text\\'s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination\" (148). In a literary text \"it is [...],\\' and not \\'me\\'\" (143). Such a decentered conception of authorship is inherently antiauthoritarian, and it comes as no surprise that postrevolutionary Russian writers who employed bricolage techniques of composition almost invariably ran afoul of the Stalinist system.\\'2 Kis was writing A Tombfor Boris Davidovich at the time when the attacks of Barthes, Foucault, and others on traditional notions of authorship were highly influential and widely discussed and accepted.13 However, as the attacks on Kis in Yugoslav literary circles show, the concept of the omnipotent author still seems appealing to some critics--even in societies that supposedly oppose the bourgeois ideology that Barthes so frequently derides. The human urge to dominate nature,', 'een published and unpublished work) than French genetic criticism would allow. The most influential declaration of the \"denial of origins\" within literary studies comes in Roland Barthes\\' famous essay, \"The Death of the Author\", when he states that \"[...]\" (BARTHES 1977a, 142). Barthes goes on to declare of the modern \"scriptor\" that: \"For him, on the contrary, the hand, cut off from any voice, borne by a pure gesture of inscription (and not of expression), traces a field without origin-or which, at least, has no other origin than language itself, language which ceaselessly calls into question all origins\" (146). The author as God, sending out a message to be accurately deciphered and understood, is replaced by a decentralized model of language as an open, ceaseless system. From such a perspective there is no absolute meaning and there can be no meaning-origins. Instead, Barthes conceives of Text as a performative event: \"writing can no longer designate an operation of recording, notation, ', 'o respond to it from within. In \"The Death of the Author\" Barthes (1977a, 145) strongly privileges the present moment in a way which encourages an elision of the duration, or sequence, essential to understanding compositional process. He states: The [...] [. . .] there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written here and now. Such a position elides process by refusing to allow that the creative act has any human \"origin\". It thus also involves a denial of will and agency, (agency is now located in language rather than in the user of it) and a denial of duration for meaning-production. It does not allow for the conception of writing as a highly repetitive process in which the \"now\" is built upon, and exists, only as a result of repeated past \"nows\". Such a position is characteristic of existential phenomenology, and of its particular conception of time and language.

This was especially true in those cases where the author happened to be dead! While for Richard Rorty, in his advocacy of \"strong misreading,\" it is legitimate for readers to beat the text into whatever shape serves their momentary purpose, Father Potter advocated imaginatively re-enacting the enduring purposes embodied in a particular text. He saw the advocacy of strong misreading as a license for textual violence (though the advocates themselves would readily admit this, countering the criticism by charging that it makes a fetish of the text). Fidelity to the text is possible only through imaginative participation in the embodied purposes ', \"ite', then one is simply playing a wilful game at the expense of category distinctions.

And so back to the second group of ' structuralists' But [...] now to Qu'est-ce que le structuralisme? In view of what has already been said about the corruption of structuralism, this book may be taken as a kind of last death-agony of unification. At least one supposes so. Can there be any more of these 'introductions' ? Five or six in two years, and all of them still-born, even in France - surely this must be significant? Look, for instance, at the opening statement by François Wahl: We will say - and it is the only way of not falling into confusion - that under the name of structuralism are grouped the sciences of the sign, and of systems of signs (p. 10). This is surely unexceptionable. Linguistics, anthropology, psychoanalysis - all these, in their structuralist dress, would fit in here.

But his hard-labored prose also risks obfuscating the originality that he seeks and nearly buries several concepts that might serve as justification for his methods. His introduction acknowledges that fiction can \"partake of or reflect\" reality (54) but that it does more when it \"reproblematizes\" the historical problems within which it is situated; so \"twenties postmobilization fiction is to a large extent shaped by its active reproblematization or counterreproblemization of the', 'ch struggles openly with the temptation of meaning\" (\"Literature and Signification\" 270).

Mystical discourse, itself made up of suspended meanings and linguistic struggles, often finds itself in an analogously awkward relationship with the discourse of systematic theology.

(PIERRE MACHEREY) Readings of The Sound and the Fury have been complicated by William Faulkner\\'s unusual, extensive \"supplementing\" of the novel during the years between its publication in 1929 and his death in 1962. He wrote about the Compsons in a few short stories and Absalom, Absalom! in the 1930s, added a long Appendix in 1946 that was published with the novel for nearly forty years, and commented on the novel at length in several interviews and in classroom discussions at the University of Virginia during the 1950s.

This is not to say that a poststructuralist such as Barthes cannot be guilty of essentializing authorship. He proposes the following as a reductive foil to the modem, Western model of the autonomous author: \"In [...] his genius\" (1967:142). 6. This liberatory aspect of Barthes\\'s and Foucault\\'s critiques of authorship resonated with the contemporary Western art of their time, especially conceptual art.

Traditional critics will establish the history of the personal relationship between the painter and the novelist.

Acquaintance with the book scarcely enlightens the viewer who examines the painting with nothing more than the social and psychological rapport existing between the protagonists.

Bigness surrenders the field to after architecture.\"34 Koolhaas continues this argument in his essay on the \"typical plan,\" by acclaiming the absentee authors of commercial architecture as an \"avant-garde of erasers,\"35 which promised architecture a kind of post-heroic status.

I agree with semioticians such as Mikhail Bakhtin and Roland Barthes that texts are polysemic, or intertextual and dialogical, and that the reader is ultimately the site of signification: \"a text,\" Barthes writes, \"is [...]\" (148). Texts are more complex, made of multiple \"writings,\" than simple reflections of authorial intent. Moreover, readers are a psychologically active and socially complex group that bring their own identities and histories, their own values and protocols for interpretation, to texts. Indeed, audiences are far too heterogeneous and complex to be duped into complete or unconscious interpellation; for that matter, the unconscious is too enigmatic and Hollywood far too dysfunctional to produce a uniform ideology.

Ralph’s “scribbling” of notes signals the preliminary, processual, and playful quality of his textual project, whose crucial purpose is precisely to counter what Todorov has called “the violence wrought upon literature by non-literature” (22), the “violent” fixation of figurative potential in critical categories. Glyph thus tends toward the textual “ideal” that Barthes promoted in S/Z as a “writerly” text of “bliss,” which programmatically promotes its own reversibility or incompleteness. Connected with the affective state of “bliss,” which Barthes theorizes in The Pleasure of the Text, the scriptible text emerges as a (partially) reversible script of significational plurality.

These passages call to mind Barthes\\'s assertion that \"writing is . . . that obliquity into which our subject flees, the black and white [...] that writes\" (55). 13 Borges\\'s narrator therefore embodies Barthes\\'s \"scriptor,\" who \"is not furnished with a being that precedes or exceeds his writing,\" who \"is not the subject of which his book would be the predicate\" (57). By subverting the supremacy of the author, Borges\\'s fiction exemplifies Barthes\\'s notion of the text as consisting \"not of a line of words releasing a single, theological meaning, the message of the author-god, but of a multidimensional space in which are married and contested several writings, none of which is original\" (57). Despite these postmodernist features, the story is also closely related to modernism.

But as a \"negative where all identity is lost,\" Barthes\\' concept of writing is more an overturn ing than a simple reversal. To liberate the text from the metaphysical re straints of the originating subject is to decenter its voice into the manifold \"conditions of exteriority\" that account for it. Recalling to us that lan guage replaces Author for Mallarm?, Val?ry, Proust, surrealism, and lin guistics, Barthes thus alludes to a counter tradition within mo', 'ithin modern literature which advocates a quite different concept of the Author from that which dominates the American critical imagination. In explaining this difference, Barthes contrasts the \"author\" of the tradi tional metaphysical view and the \"[...]\" (p. 145). This scriptor arises from the relations Foucault outlines, and does not exercise the sort of interpretive control or ideologically limiting function assumed in our more conventional belief in the Author. The positing of a subject-predicate model is rather like a back-formation by which beliefs in intentionality and causality lead one to project a non-linguistic subject onto syntax. Barthes instead argues the performative nature of any literary or linguistic utter ance, with the Author being a product of the interplay among competing discourses and conventions. When we turn to Fowles\\' scattered comments on the issue, we can cer tainly locate conventional ideas, as in the case of his observation that \"the whole meaning and commitm', ' the poetics of an earlier paradigm to \"make sense\" of it.

A later version empha sizes what Josue Harari calls', 'bjects \"like a camera\" (Robbe-Grillet); presents the \"Tropisms\" by which the whole can be conjured from the minimal signs (Sarraute); fashions a \"magic realism\" that was always the promise of film; gives us the (too) close-up vision of Yuppie angst, [...]; still swirls in its metafictional inquiries, becoming ever more hermetic; offers the tired old poignancies about the \"human heart,\" the replications of the creaky machine Humanism; follows all the oscillation between sight and insight, word and image, that is art in the age of mechanical reproduction. Robert Coates discovered a great deal in writing The Eater of Darkness about form, signification, realism, culture, commodification, and learned, after its publication, just how little certain preservers of the modern literary order and the mass of nostalgic readers wished to know about these matters. And he learned that, indeed, in the age of mechanical reproduction, \"at any moment the reader is ready to turn into the writer,\" to seize the ', 'way the past can be apprehended: as process, in motion. For all of us, life is a fiction for the reason that when we \"give an account\" of ourselves, even to ourselves, it takes the form of narrative. In Barthes\\'s conception, the \"I\" of my \"self\" is \"[...] I\";17 similarly, our \"selves\" are made up of the story we tell ourselves in our consciousness every day. \"No one and nothing lives a story,\" Hayden White reminds us;\\'8 but the only way we get a sense of our lives as such is by imposing a story frame on our experience. As Seymour Chatman says, the terms \"beginning,\" \"middle,\" and \"end\" are \"meaningless in the real world.\"\\'19 And yet we all impose this structure on what has happened when we tell it to others or even to ourselves. Thus the main perception we have of our own life is figured by this ongoing narrative, and an autobiography is only a more formal equivalent of this discourse we create when we review our life. In effect, we perceive our life as lived up to the present as a narrativ', 'es’ and Foucault’s essays are much more intricate than the facile dismissal suggests, and have not been explored enough, due to an emotional response that blocked readers off from their complexity.

His structuralist argument foregrounds questions of language; for Barthes, the origin of meaning lies in language itself, and he is skeptical about the notion of a singular identity of the self. Barthes contends that an author can disappear, leaving behind the subjectivity of the reader, which can then supercede an author\\'s traditionally privileged subject position. This reveals the fact that the death of the author might work against any potential claims to a stable personal identity of any kind. Some forty years later, in the wake of the rise of (real and fictionalized) contemporary autobiography, this raises complicated questions about genre and verisimilitude.

With the death of the author a text becomes untethered from its author such that the author can no longer be considered the transcendent source of meaning of a text and the authority for how a text must be interpreted. Contrary to conventional views, texts do not transmit a singular, fixed meaning knowable by knowing the author\\'s life history, cultural context, or intentions. In Theory for Performance Studies (2008: 46-47), published four years after our book, Philip Auslander introduces the same idea as follows: Barthes\\'s declaration that the author is dead is not merely an obituary for the old way of understanding textual meaning. Rather, it has important ramifications for where we understand meaning', 'nd creatively shaping her biography to create the impression of herself as a unique, extraordinary individual. Roland Barthes famously sought to reduce the author to a function of the text, claiming in 1968 that the cultural image of literature was ‘[...]’.9 An anti-biographical critical stance is completely unsuited to the case of Akhmatova, who has entered the canon as a biography and personality — a literary celebrity and ‘figure [...] in Russian history’, as Berlin puts it. As this essay shows, the ‘passive resistance’ that he highlights made her a particularly important role model and emblematic figurehead for the Russian intelligentsia.

Such a view of textuality in relation to the writer and reader was further developed by Roland Barthes and Julia Kristeva.

(Barthes 1977, 148) The term \\'intertextuality\\' was first coined by Julia Kristeva, after her readings of Bakhtin. According to her, in the space of a given text, several utterances, taken from other texts, intersect and neutralise one another; any text is constructed as a mosaic of quotations; any text is an absorption of and a reply to another text (Kristeva 1980, 36). An important insight offered by Kristeva is the subversive nature of intertextuality, or \\'transposition\\' as she preferred to call it at a later stage to discourage the banal reading of a study of sources: \"[W]e prefer th', 'ven say: a product - in literature.

The Godard who lives on after his authorial death is not a scriptor, but rather a receiver. What he receives is language itself, which now emerges as the veritable agent both of speech and writing. Finally, in JLG/JLG language enjoys a radically expanded meaning. It includes not only the linguistic and cinematic signifier, but also sensory perception of all sorts. JLG/JLG begins with a ringing telephone, and this sound is a repeated one elsewhere in the film.

Recognizing this potentially troubling scholarly trend, in their piece \"The Bondwoman\\'s Narrative: Text, Paratext, Intertext and Hypertext\" (2005), Celeste-Marie Bernier and Judie Newman question Gates\\'s and others\\' all consuming attention to the woman behind the manuscript.

Accordingly, for Barthes \"[t]o write is, through a prerequisite impersonality ..., to [...],\\' and not \\'me\\'.\"7 This \"prerequisite impersonality\" is already compromised by the narrative\\'s alleged status as an autobiography, a generic designation that is signaled by the \"official\" title penned on the first page of the manuscript. Such a title, as well as its presentation in the facsimile preface, clearly attempts to locate the text within the tradition of the slave narrative or ex-slave autobiography, striv ing to authenticate the status of the author with the qualifying description \"A Fugitive Slave Recently Escaped from North Carolina.\" The author, or the \"me\" behind the text, is highlighted before the narrative even starts.

Barthes gestures toward the legitimacy of such textual, tonal, and perspectival hybridity when he writes that \"[w]e know now that a text is not a line of words releasing a single \\'theological\\' mean ing (the \\'message\\' of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash\" (146).

No lateral Gallic influence is mentioned by either US critic, and neither critic was, it is perhaps needless to say, a fan of French theory. Nonetheless it is striking, half a century later, to see how the conditions of previous criticism had, in effect, set the stage for these interventions, which seem both so individual and so characteristic. “Melancholy” was what Bloom saw in Bate’s account of modernity (“The modern poet, as W. J. Bate shows in The Burden of the Past and the English Poet, ', 'sonality. This \\'personality\\' involves that character\\'s worldview, typical mode of speech, ideological and social positioning, all of which are expressed through the character\\'s words\" (23).

The more-than qualities of the dead relative’s hun live on as the ginseng is steeped into longevity tea. “The writer can only imitate a gesture,” says Barthes in his essay, “Death of the Author,” “that is [...].”2 Barthes insists that an author – the subject doing the writing – does not exist prior to or outside of language, that is, it is the writing that is anterior to the author. The identifiable body of the author is only along for the ride. For Barthes, there is no subject to throw under, nor is there an authority to do the throwing (although, the irony of Barthes’s own death – he succumbed to injuries after he was struck by a laundry van – does not go unnoticed as a subject). Instead, “[The author’s] only power is to mix writings [...] in such a way as never to rest on any one of them.”3 This is a challenging reorientation.

A link between literature and performatives was already perceived by Barthes: \"Writing [in the sense of ecriture] can no [...]\" (Barthes 1977: 145). Barthes did not go beyond this passing remark. 25. If we want to express the authenticating illocutionary act by an explicit performative formula, we could suggest the prefix: Let it be. 26. It is true that the actual source of all speech acts in narrative is the author. In the narrative text itself, however, there is no author\\'s discourse. By a generic convention, discourses of the narrative text are assigned to different fictional sources (the narrator, the acting characters). It is a commonly accepted principle of narrative theory that the narrator cannot be identified with the author. For this reason, the so-called sayso pragmatics of fictionality which relies on the author\\'s authority (Woods 1974: 24ff.) is misdi', 'post)romantic discourses of authorship often presuppose the f initeness of, and indissoluble tie between, an author and his or her oeuvre (Bennett 2005: 55). As Roland Barthes (1977: 147) famously observed in his essay The Death of the Author, ‘[t]o [...] it with a f inal signif ied, to close the writing’. Yet the process of authorial branding is characterized precisely by a proliferation of meaning (which can, but does not necessarily have to be controlled by a managerial strategy, as the next section will show) and a disconnection of author and text. After all, Bukowski did not author the phrase ‘What would Bukowski do?’, but it is nonetheless an undeniable product of the signifying potential of his oeuvre. Likewise, his work does not contain references to, for instance, the ‘Bukowski Tavern’, but his name has been effectively aff ixed to the restaurants bearing that name in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a mark of quality. It is this productive, expansive dimension of branded au', 'reativity is a \"repetition ... of the eternal I AM\" (202) seems to have been lost, even as the notion of a creative author has been lost . As Roland Barthes announced in 1968, \"Writing is that neutral, composite, ob- 59 \\n 60 Cath Filmer-Davies lique [...] The author enters into his own death\" (168). Of course, as Booth\\'s approach shows, there are contrary arguments. Nathan A. Scott asserts that \"a radically secular literature may have a profoundly fruitful religious function to perform\" (208), and J. Hillis Miller offers the following observation: There can be for many writers no return to the traditional conception of God as the highest experience, creator of all other existences, transcending his creation as well as dwelling within it. If there is to be a God in the new world it must be a presence within things and not beyond them. The new poets have at the farthest limits of their experience caught a glimpse of a fugitive presence, something shared by all things in the fact that they are', 'and authorizing principle, Tim O\\'Brien\\'s fictionalized account of Vietnam hinges on Tim O\\'Brien\\'s believability as a narrator and implied author.12 Even Barthes, who infamously proclaimed the death of the author and the birth of the reader, argues: \"[...] ing\" (147). Thus the assumption of an author allows the text to coa lesce into a stable body that might be investigated. The notion of the author is, as Foucault explains, \"more than a gesture, a finger pointed at someone; it is, to a certain extent, the equivalent of a description\" (\"What Is an Author?\" Language 121). \"[S]ituated in the breach, among the discontinuities,\" the author is \"not a function of man\\'s civil status, nor is it fictional\" (123). It is precisely in this in between space that the character-narrator Tim O\\'Brien exists, always connected to the biographical finger to which it points and also fundamentally distinct. The \"author-function\" is, as Foucault instructs, \"a projection\" (127), which is used by the reader in the a', 'ant. Romanticism consecrates this figure. The writer expresses, discloses the feelings and imaginings of a particular inner self. Referring to the \"prestige of the individual\" or the \"human person,\" Barthes says it is logical that in literature \"the [...] to the \\'person of the author\\' \" (143). Thus our culture had sought for a long time the explanation of a work in the man or woman who produced it. From the second half of the nineteenth century some writers put in question the primacy of the subject as owner and observer of thoughts, emotions and actions. What Foucault frequently calls the \"sovereignty of the subject\" is taken apart, decentered by writers like Marx and Nietzsche and by the disciplines of psychoanalysis, linguistics and ethnology. The author\\'s inner world is removed from the text and replaced by \"an obscure set of anonymous rules\" (Archaeology 210). Discourse is \"not the majestically unfolding manifestation of a thinking, knowing, speaking subject, but, on the contrary, a to', 'of author from text but also of the fact that writing itself is a \"multidimensional space in which a variety of writings S. . blend and clash . . a tissue of quotations\" (Barthes \"Death\" 146).

Rather, it is primarily concerned with creating an opening where the writing subject endlessly disappears\" (Language 116). For modern writers, and for linguistics, Barthes tells us, writing is inscription, not expression. The belief in the Author e', ' the betrayal of the inner self. Repeatedly he writes about the duplicity of writing and portrays the work as a haunting, tormenting double. Unamuno is very far from accepting with equanimity Barthes\\' formulation that \"the inner \\'thing\\' [the author] [...].\" Unamuno believes that although words belong to the world and not to the speaker, there is an \"inner fountain,\" an intimate and invisible substance that comes from \"roots\" within the writer. \"The language that I use to dress my feelings and my ideas is the language of the society in which I live. . the very images and concepts are the images and concepts of those who hear me; but the sap, that life-giving sap . . that sap which cannot be seen, this is mine\" (III, 1032). Unamuno frequently sees the inner world as the only locus of freedom. \"Freedom lies in mystery; freedom is buried and grows inwards and not outwards\" (1033).

And this turn toward the reader is esp', 'passages from \"The Death.\" For example, Barthes\\'s famous passage critiquing the notion of an \"Author-God\" delivering messages takes on new resonances when the essay is seen in the context of its publication: We know that a text does not consist of a [...]\" meaning (the \"message\" of the Author-God), but is a space of many dimensions, in which are wedded and contested various kinds of writing, no one of which is original: the text is a tissue of citations, resulting from the thousand sources of culture. (\"The Death\") Literary scholars and critics have, for years, been attracted to the idea in Barthes\\'s parentheses, but reading \"The Death\" in its specific context reveals this passage to be very much about the space of writing. The notion that \"a text does not consist of a line of words\" is itself powerful, but in its initial presentation, Barthes\\'s argument was dramatically underscored by the pointedly alinear body of texts within the Aspen 5+6 box. Aspen 5+6 is itself \"a space of many dimensi', ' and contested various kinds of writing.\" \\n 508 College English Barthes goes on to contrast linear, \"single-meaning\" writings with a more spa tially expansive and permeable model: In a multiple writing, indeed, everything is to be distinguished, but [...]\" (like a stocking that has rim) in all its recurrences and all its stages, but there is no underlying ground; the space of the writing is to be traversed, not penetrated: writing ceaselessly posits meaning but always in order to evaporate it: it proceeds to a systematic exemption of meaning. (\"The Death\") When abstracted from its original context, this passage seems to be directed at the nature of textual meaning and the limits of interpretation. But within Aspen 5+6, it is apparent that Barthes is also emphasizing how much space matters. When he writes \"there is no underlying ground,\" he does so in the context of an array of texts that are—quite literally—unbound. In the absence of binding, Barthes encourages the reader to thread together', 'be distinguished, but nothing deciphered; structure can be followed, \"threaded\" (like a stocking that has rim) in all its recurrences and all its stages, but there is no underlying ground; the space of the writing is to be traversed, not penetrated: [...] but always in order to evaporate it: it proceeds to a systematic exemption of meaning.

If we accept this view of literary theory, then in those cases in Dupin's poetry in which the speaking voice is not identified, we know it to be the voice of language itself. This prominence of writing as speaking voice gives us a situation in which poetic essence and the medium of poetic engendering fuse almost indistinguishably.

Just a few years earlier, in his \"The Death of the Author\" (1968), Roland Barthes had similarly associated the reader with a paradoxical space of heterogeneous sublimity: \"A [...] [ . .]\" (148). In this often-cited phrase, Barthes conceives the reader as a location of perfect reception in which contradiction and multiplicity are transcended in their simultaneous and absolute intelligibilityas a space in which nothing is wasted because nothing is lost. Barthes\\'s projection of the reader in this quotation has its roots in the structuralist idea of intertextuality: the presupposition of a space of unlimited semiosis that avowedly provided the conditions of possibility for meaning for any text-a textual homologue of the relational and differential nature of meaning that Saussure had posited in the linguistic realm. In a splendid essay entitled \"Presupposition and Intertextuality,\" Jonathan Culler later evinced conclusiv', 'ments argued that the study of literature ought to focus on the immanent properties of texts, and were thus strictly limited to literary interpretation.

The scriptor, by contrast, ‘is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written here and now’ (ibid., p. 5). The death of the author, then, obviously does not refer to an empirical fact. It is, as Burke notes, ‘a call to arms and not a funeral oration’ (2008, p. 27). Barthes urges us to approach literary works in a new way: We should seize the initiative as readers and not grant the biographical author mastery of the text. We should think of all of literature as one massive text, an interlinked fabric with threads to be traced ', 'r. The Author is thought to nourish the book, which is to say that he exists before it, thinks, suffers, lives for it, is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his child’ (Barthes, 2002, p. 5). The scriptor, by contrast, ‘is [...] here and now’ (ibid., p. 5). The death of the author, then, obviously does not refer to an empirical fact. It is, as Burke notes, ‘a call to arms and not a funeral oration’ (2008, p. 27). Barthes urges us to approach literary works in a new way: We should seize the initiative as readers and not grant the biographical author mastery of the text. We should think of all of literature as one massive text, an interlinked fabric with threads to be traced in all directions, rather than some chronology of distinct works with precise meanings we can unearth one by one with the aid of each creator’s life and design. This is a rather counterintuitive form of reading, however, and Peter Lamarque is surely right that it tends to be ‘more interesting, m', ' suggestion, an invitation, a manifesto, a strategic hypothesis, or speculative experiment, yet it is largely framed as a statement of fact. For example, Barthes writes assertively, as if he were announcing a philosophical breakthrough, that ‘We now [...]” meaning (the “message” of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash’ (2002, p. 6), that ‘it is language which speaks, not the author’ (ibid., p. 4), and that ‘a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination’ (ibid., p. 7). Burke is right, however, that ‘the decision as to whether we read a text with or without an author remains an act of critical choice governed by the protocols of a certain way of reading rather than any “truth of writing”’ (2008, p. 169). Copyright law’s utilitarian function means that ‘ought’ and ‘is’ are reasonably distinct most of the time, and we can bring either dimension into sharp focus: First, we can adopt a normative perspec', 'argely framed as a statement of fact.

Alternatively, w', 'task of \"scripting\" traditionally ascribed to the author figure.

[T]he birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author.4 Like Eco, Barthes\\'s emphasis on the central role played by the reader in the production of literary meaning is conditioned by a distinct historical moment, that of the rise of postmodern criticism in the wake of the 1968 student uprisings throughout Western Europe that so comprehensively challenged practices of learning and criticism associated with the established institutions of scholarship. Given the distinct historical, cultural, and methodological roots of the notion of \"openness,\" it might appear problematic to apply it to a study of Andrei Platonov\\'s works.5 And even if we leave aside the theoretical problem of whether post-structuralist theory can be ap', 'intillating account of Aulus Gellius’ Noctes Atticae, where “the themes are not so much integrated as interwoven, like separate strands that can each be picked out from the texture of the sequence” (189; I am reminded of Barthes in “The Death of the [...] can be . . . ‘run’ [like the thread of a stocking]”). This summary, however, makes the book sound rather more orderly than it is. It is not a history, the coverage being too arbitrary, as Fitzgerald darts about between periods and texts (what he terms “bouncing around”), and, like Francis Cairns, he tends to treat antiquity as something of “a time-free zone.” Nor is it a rigorous philosophic enquiry into a concept or discourse. In Paterian terms it is not a treatise, but rather an essay, in the manner of Montaigne, appropriately informal and various. The word itself is constantly shifting, now a concept, now an experience, a value, or a critical problem. Fitzgerald keeps returning to the same range of ideas, probing them in different ways ', '[...] with thevery identity of the body writing. ?Roland Barthes1 The novelist must accept his or her life as fact, realizing that it makes no difference whether someone proclaims or even believes that he or she is dead. ?Percival Everett2 My title follows predictably from Percival Everett\\'s 2001 publication, described on the dust jacket as \"a novel of family, race, and publishing in America.\" Perhaps it is just as predictable that the second of these topics monopolized media coverage of Everett\\'s most admired and widely-reviewed novel since his first, Suder, appeared in 1983. This is the case despite, as well as because of, the fact that Erasure questions the meaning of the descriptor. To call Erasure a novel \"of\" race is to note its elements o', 'ly be partial, incomprehensible, or mystical.

With Lady Chatterley, we see this in practice. The obvious nudity, notorious within C', 'lighieri, Inferno In his early essay The Death of the Author, Roland Barthes suggests that the nature of writing is such that it is not proper for the critic to discuss the author, let alone the body of the author. \"Writing,\" Barthes claims, \"is the [...] into which our subject flees, the black-and-white where all identity is lost beginning with the very body that writes\" (49). By positing that the act of writing precipitates not just the death of the author, but also by extension the decomposition of the body of the author, Barthes implies that critical interest in this body is tantamount to critical necrophilia. Yet while the early Barthes clearly sanctions this type of criticism, the late Barthes willingly indulges in critical practice - or rather malpractice - on the body of the author. For instance, in his later essay The Pleasure of the Text, Barthes, while still believing in the death of the author \"as an institution\" (27), celebrates the reader\\'s desire for the figure of the author.', 'nality and Spectacular Authorship in Pier Paolo Pasolini\\'s Interviews. Simona Bondavalli Since Roland Barthes\\' obituary to the author in 1969, critical discourse on the subject of authorship has proliferated: the definitive-sounding statements that \"[...] origin\" and that \"to impose an author on a text is to close writing\" (Barthes 142), steered the discourse toward a redefinition of the author, rather than to his dismissal. The first such redefinition appeared in Michel Foucault\\'s essay \"What is an Author?\" in the same year: the death of the author determined the birth of the author function, as that which \"characterize[s] the existence, circulation and operation of certain discourses within a society\" (Language, Countermemory, Practice 124). While critical theory tried to come to terms with the \"death and return of the author\" for the following two decades,\\' as late as 1994 Martha Woodmansee and PeterJaszi saw the need to address the persistence of the Romantic notion of authorship as sol', 'heses are not mutually exclusive, that Hemingway\\'s experience of the war was engendered and that his sexual identity was influenced by his military experiences. In other words, when critics heed Roland Barthes\\' warning that a text \"consists not of a [...] in which are married and contested several writings\" (52-53), we will all be better off.5 •After railing against Professor Young\\'s thesis for several years, Hemingway agreed with the gist of it in letters to Malcolm Cowley (Lynn, Hemingway 106-107) and to a New York Times reporter who was writing an introduction to a Hemingway reader (Hemingway to Charles Poore, 23 January 1953 [Selected Letters 798]). Not surprisingly, Professor Lynn views these letters as \"warm-ups for the gloss he offered the public at large in A Moveable Feast\" (Hemingway 107). \\'The Young and Lynn interpretations only seem incompatible, partly due to Professor Lynn\\'s customary belligerence in arguing his point. More interesting are the similarities: both perceive in He', \" 'there is more to La Nausée than a single reading can reveal':40 interpretation is dependent on the subjectivity of the individual. In La Mort de l'auteur (1977), Roland Barthes states that the reader is the space in which the text is inscribed; 'a [...] but in its destination'.41 Such association of a work's continued significance with its reader illuminates the implications of La Nausée's conclusion. For its ending does not signify an ending: one does not ask 'do we have to leave?' (118), like the old man in the Bouville library, because it is in the continued application of essence, regardless of whether it be factitious or transcendental, that man exists in the world: 'on all sides I escape being and yet I am'.42 Through Roquentin's literary ambition, La Nausée designates its ending as another beginning; alluding to the continuation of the individual's pursuit of understanding in an absurd world. Tomorrow will again require Roquentin to understand, to apply essence to existence: 'Tomor\", ' narrating once the author has finished writing, but at the same time, the final fruition of the text occurs when it is read, an act that implies the logical conclusion of the linguistic process, the reception/interpretation of the narrative.

In a 1940 letter to T.S.

Postmodern narrative explores the limits of fantasy by approximating each of those elements that compose Ostrowski\\'s definition of pure fantasy: (1) creatures completely different from us; (2) space-time settings completely alien to us; and (3) a nonhuman language. The most difficult of those elements to approximate is the first. In what way can a creature be completely different from us? It can look radically unlike we look, but wouldn\\'t it simply be a composite of other creatures we have seen? And if we ', 'er - or the \"scriptor\" in Barthes\\' terminology - comes to life at the same time as the text being read. Barthes consistently emphasizes the performative aspect of fiction, which, according to him, functions as any other linguistic utterance because \"[...] here and now \" (148-49, emphasis original). Thus, from the reader\\'s standpoint, the act of reading involves the instantaneous re-writing of the text and the completion of its signification. Both writing and reading (or re-writing) function as speech acts, consuming themselves in the same instant in which they occur. Writing \"can no longer designate an operation of recording, notation, representation, \\'depiction,\\'\" remarks Barthes; thus, writing is enunciation, a performative act of creating signification (148-49). While the author recedes in the background of his narrative, the narrator, the characters (or narratees), and the reader become one: ontological boundaries collapse as long as the process of reading/rewriting lasts.11 Any vicario', 'ed in 1967, just as the concept of 44the author\" was receiving death threats.

His stance here is somewhat that of spokesman repre\\xad senting to a broader readership (broa', \"p short of such pronouncements, the contributions of Barthes to an understanding of the dynamic role the reader plays in the construction of a work cannot be overestimated.

If our analogy to reading holds, any engagement of the senses-particularly the sense of sight upon which we are focusing here-would require an active response from the percipient to be registered as significant. In the act of observing works of art (or any other class of objects worthy of our attention) it would seem essential to acknowledge that the observer not only creates the object by virtue of her directed gaze, but creates the self by virtue of engaging what, for the observer, are significant objects. Art historian Donald Preziosi has commented on the necessity of a viewing subject who engages a process of differentiation in order to locate the self in a 'signifying practice'. He writes in his recent book, Rethinking Art Histo\", ' (within stories) are generated, the un-get-at-able absent origin or center shared between writer and reader which eludes our grasp as soon as differences start proliferating again.

Rabate\\'s books will no doubt be disconcerting to those who still consider that the quintessence of good literary criticism or even \"theory\" is to have one central, summarizable thesis that one argues through in order to provide clear-cut, seemingly definitive answers 507 \\n and that \"magnetizes\" all developments, rather than to trace out', 'as a given, possessed of a self-referential identity.7 He is hardly the first to assign autonomy to one component of the reading process. When, for example, Barthes celebrated the \"death of the author\" and the \"birth of the reader,\"8 he defined the \\'[...]\"9 that finds meaning in \"that someone who holds together in a single field all the traces by which the written text is constituted.\"10 For him, the autonomous reader was the locus of meaning. A more profitable understanding of \\'text\\', as well as \\'reader\\' and \\'author\\', arises from their matric productivity in reading. Underlying my thinking about \\'text\\' is Heidegger\\'s claim that understanding existence is always dependent on an inherited view of the world (a \"fore-having\") as a \"totality of relevance\" - a perception of how \\'reality\\' is organized, from our vantage point - that calls for interpretation based on a 5 Breed, Nomadic Text , 65. 6 Anti-essentialism correctly debunks the idea that something can be defined with reference to itself, ', '. In his seminal 1968 essay, “The Death of the Author,” Roland Barthes implores his readers to acknowledge the death of the author in order to liberate the reader.3 Using structuralist insights on language as a system, Barthes posits that the act of [...]” (142). He argues that by falling back upon the concept of an idealized, corporeal, and totalizable author, we lose the ability to appreciate how texts function. Barthes is laying the foundation of an argument that he would develop over the course of his career: the movement away from autonomous literary work to contingent cultural text. Replacing the author, he posits a modern scriptor that would emerge “simultaneously with the text,” never “preceding or exceeding the writing” (146). Barthes makes the case that any analysis of iteration and representation must consider the social, interactive, and communicative function of language, and not just the biography, psychology, and intentionality of the author (or, parallel with the “author,” a', ', interactive, and communicative function of language, and not just the biography, psychology, and intentionality of the author (or, parallel with the “author,” an idealized “work” of the sort posited by some formalists, such as the New Critics). He [...]” (148). In order to recognize Barthes’s insight, it is important to note the intellectual relevance of authorship to virtually every facet of humanistic scholarly inquiry. During the modern era, the humanistic traditions of literature, philosophy, and history all developed in conjunction with, and were reinforced by, the concept of individualized authorship. Thus, Barthes was responding to both academic and popular representations of authorship with his polemical essay, concluding with his now famous dictum, “The birth of the Reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author” (148). The following year, Foucault responded to Barthes with “What Is an Author?” which develops the concept of the author-function.4 The notion of the corporeal', 'iness and philosophy the corporate vision of BEEF-EX. In a sense, the man and the company become interchangeable. This fungibility is no mistake—Roland Barthes draws attention to the fact that the figure of the author emerged in modern times as \"the [...]\" (1995,126). As Jane\\'s New York-based boss, Kenji, reminds her, \"BEEF-EX is paying your rent\" (Ozeki 1998, 165). Unlike the empress who provides Shönagon with paper (the \"pillow\" of The Pillow Book) and willingly—even lovingly—supports all the unusual prose she writes upon it, Joichi stifles Jane\\'s attempts at creativity. In response, Jane attempts to appease Joichi\\'s authorial demands, however incompatible with her own beliefs, because she needs a paycheck. Barthes\\'s invocation of the \"Author-God\" (1995,128) here reminds us that, with his control over the text\\'s ideas as well as its budget and production, \"John\" wields all the creative power. In fact, one can summarize Ozeki\\'s storyline as a series of battles for creative will, on the one', 'nt (Ozeki 1998, 30), she very belatedly makes the connection between editing, power, and authorship, a relationship that Barthes clarifies in his distinctions between the Author and the \"modern scriptor.\" The scriptor\\'s hand, Barthes emphasizes, is \"[...]) . . . the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original. His only power is to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others, in such a way as never to rest on any one of them\" (1995,128). In a sense, what Barthes describes as the modern scriptor essentially mimics the role of a film editor, piecing together elements toward a dynamic end. Jane\\'s initial emphasis on her own multiculturalism and difference blinds her to the ways her preliminary struggles with My American Wife! reveal her as more of a tyrannical author than a modern scriptor. Ironically, had Jane moved more readily beyond contemplations of her own difference, she would have more quickly discerned that she was imposing this lens of difference on', 'ikely to bring his own life to an end. As we see him for the last time, he believes he has finally achieved freedom: ‘Il tira: il était pur, il était tout-puissant, il était libre’ (p. 245). Here, Sartre’s character, his novel and his career as a [...] they have not much further to go. The war allows Mathieu to become free. The statement that ‘il était libre’ might remind us of Sartre’s claim, quoted at the beginning of this chapter, that the Occupation allowed ‘us’ (‘nous’) – presumably the French people – to realize an unprecedented freedom. This returns us to the question of who this ‘we’, this collective totality, can be, and who can speak on its behalf. For the author of ‘La République du silence’, the experience of the French people during the Occupation is difficult to understand and recount, yet nevertheless intelligible and recountable; it is not the same for everyone in every part of France, and yet to a significant degree it is shared. And Sartre, as its pre-eminent interpre', 'ludes that \"the notion of intertextuality replaces that of intersubjec tivity\" (37; emphasis in original). In \"Death of the Author,\" written two years later in 1968, Roland Barthes introduces similar ideas when he states that writing constitutes the [...]. Abolishing the notion of an author, which he regards as a product of Renaissance human ism and capitalism, and of origins, Barthes claims that the text does not con sist of a line of words \"releasing a single \\'theological\\' meaning (the \\'message\\' of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quo tations drawn from the innumberable centres of culture\" (1977, 146). Thus, both Kristeva and Barthes replace the concept of an author that \"fathers\" a text with that of intertextuality, a mosaic or an impersonal blending or inter secting of various texts. Both Barthes and Kristeva, then, distinguish inter textuality from the traditional notion of infl', ' crystallized two years later when Roland Barthes declared the “death of the author.” Whereas Kristeva retains Bakhtin’s interpretation of the novel as a heteroglossia of polyvocal dialogics, Barthes argued for the ghostly, fatal agency of language.

Prior to this moment, as Jay Clayton, Eric Rothstein, and Susan Stanford Friedman explain in Influence and Intertextuality in Literary History (1991), influence studies had developed inextricably with the rise of imperialism. The late 1960s saw French post-structuralists use theories of intertextuality as part of their “intellectual overthrow of the ancien régime of humanism—with its tie to capitalism and imperialism.”8 Kristeva and Barthes banished the author, Friedman observes, as “part of a gener', 'ola, inglesa, francesa), como ha hecho Johnson, no es dif?cil descubrir que los estereotipos propiciados en Tun tun de pasa y grifer?a disfrutan de un larga y extensa tradici?n.

A letter she wrote some months before her death shows a feeling for her characters that is again described by Barthes: \"The [...]\": \\'When I leave stories half-finished,\" Emily says, \"I feel as though I\\'ve abandoned the characters, that I owe them more than that.

She yearned to go', 'or. As is well-known, Barthes\\'s \"The Death of the Author\" proclaimed just that, and in so doing sought to liberate a text from any one particular highest authority. Barthes instead imagines a text created by the interaction of a reader with writing: [...].28 By killing off the author, Barthes, like Nietzsche and his followers, also decapitates the pyramid, appropriately dubbing the act \"anti-theological.\" As Headlam tells us, \"Barthes advocated space for the reader, where no one reading can claim authority (p. 322; italics added). Michel Foucault\\'s essay \"What is an Author\" provides Headlam with a basis for resurrecting some aspects of the author. Headlam seizes upon three of Foucault\\'s features of authors as bases for his ensuing argument: [1] The author denotes a system of ownership and copyright. \\n Review 199 [2] Throughout history the extent to which the status of works has depended on a recognized author has varied.

Certainly, the problem is only compounded when “The Grain of the Voice” is read against defi nitions of reception such as that given in “The Death of the Author”: if Barthes, like Cavarero, might claim that “a text’s [...] fi eld all the traces by which the written text is constituted.”63 Quite evidently, without “history, biography, or psychology,” the individual is all too individual: now just a “someone,” with no traces of a shared or structural marking that would connect him or her to other “someones.” The fi eld is much too “single”; gone is any notion of “coupling” with others. It is as if Barthes, so as to prevent the disembodiment of his most beloved experiences, their reduction to abstract, theoretical, and exchangeable categories, instead prefers to refuse the communicability of the “grain” even as he defi nes it as a phenomenon doubly (or triply) mediated by language (in the encounter between voice and language, the defi nition of voice out of a b', ' commencer par celle-là même du corps qui écrit’ [Literature is precisely the invention of this voice, to which we cannot assign a specific origin: literature is that neuter, that composite, that oblique into which every subject escapes, the trap [...] that writes],60 Roland Barthes writes.

An indispensable tool for any writer, the hand takes an even more central and paradoxical role for Scott who had to cope with a hand which recurring illnesses often made useless. Frequently unable to write down his own stories, he had to resort to helping hands, whether they were family members, friends or literary partners. It seems to me that his work revolves around a reflexion on the hand motif which is displaced from the physical to the metaphorical, from the literal to the aesth', '. 120 I.

In the case of “Night Onboard,” the author’s identity, or even the dating of the composition, does influence the reading of the sentiment of the lyric “I.” It is the purported lyric truth of the “author” in the instance of writing.

The text thus unfolds itself into an open space of creative cacophony. A Creative Cacophony The coexistence of multiple forms of memories in one poem means the coexistence of voices including, but not limited to, the authorial intent. In the case of “Night Onboard,” the voices of the ancient patriots are not necessarily in tune with each other, or even with the authorial voice. The lyric subjectivity insists on their harmony and invites future readers', 'to the words on the page, not to construct suppositions as to what effects the author intended.

This specific notion concerning the general openness of the text also includes the traditional role of its author, whose function as the essential creator of his own text Barthes radically denied in his famous 1968 essay “La mort de l’auteur” (“The Death of the Author”). In it, Barthes splits the author’s position in two: the auteur plays the traditional role as the privileged and authorized creator of text, who is able to live a life also outside the text; whereas the modern scripteur exists only within the text, as more its product than its creator, and does not claim to be imposing any first-hand interpretation of that text.

Indeed, Gass\\' work reveals an ambivalence on this matter of textuality and authority-an ambivalence that obtains in much of postmodern American fiction.

While its early theorists held that authorial intention was irrelevant to intertextuality, in its current form the term has come to signify what M. H. Abrams defines as 'the multiple ways in which any one literary text is made up of other texts', including 'open or covert citations or allusions', as well as its engagement with earlier texts and the 'common stock' of literary conventions.6 Intertextuality has become too ubiquitous\", ' embedded in Turner\\'s works.

But there is always a variety of possible readings (beyond merely individual appropriations), readings beyond the control of any single authority. One may approach a classic ethnography seeking simply to grasp the meanings that the researcher derives from represented cultural facts.

This voice, like the multiply authored surrealist projects referred to by Barthes, reminds us of authorship\\'s plural, rather than unified nature-it presents the authorship of The Sweet Hereafter as collaborative and intermediated, as well as an ongoing process of conversation. At times, the substance of this conversation seems to exclude the viewer by positing Egoyan and Banks as the only true authors of The Sweet Hereafter, the only ones with the knowledge and authority to speak over its images. But at other times, the commentary seems to invite viewers to imagine t', 'hich seeps away the meaning of things known. We do not even have a choice. For us, historians in a historicist civilization, the question of the intersection of literature with history, of literature and history, remains open indeed. To consider it, [...] to the reign of terror, a moment suspended in history, a moment bereft of meaning, where meaning begins to find articulation. This reign of terror is the blind joint which dictates our vision, the theater at once \"ideal\" and void of the total drama (jeu) in which history and literature, disarticulated, become confused in excessive rationalism or in pure literalism. At its extreme limit (never actually reached, since it would be the outer edge of limitlessness itself) the reign of terror represents the moment at which the very language which names and organizes the world flows out in an uninterrupted tide intent on wiping out the boundaries of the world as established by law (the law of language) - the \"major impropriety\" of Sade as Blancho', 'uations of narrative \"logic\" (Image-Music-Text, 124), rather than anything referentially or deeply tragic or erotic.

The answer to a structuralist critic\\'s prayer, these novels appear to offer a simple, objective mode of narrative without the least trace of anything subjective or tragic. Thus, according to Barthes\\'s essay entitled \"Objective Literature\" (1954), Robbe- Grillet\\'s fiction: has no alibi, no density and no depth: it remains on the surface of the object and inspects it impartially ... it is the exact opposite of poetic writing.

Barthes\\'s way of putting it was somewhat more inspiriting than the transmogrification of authors into func? tions or problems: \"We [...].\" What Barthes was celebrating, in language permeated with the rhetoric of liberation, was release from the very idea of an origin; it was nothing less than that staple of the sixties, the death of God. Barthes made sure his language told the story. The Author is \"believed in\"; his image is to be \"desacralized,\" and with it his theological meaning. He is the God, \"the origin, the authority, the Father\" (as Barthes would write two years later), and not a very nice one. Literature is centered on him \"tyrannically\"; his \"sway\" is \"powerful\"; the new literature, now to be renamed writing, \"liberates\"; the Author is a myth it is \"necessary to overthrow.\" Criticism, as Barthes would tell UExpress in 1970, could participate in \"a kind of collecti', ' 378 THE HUDSON REVIEW prisoners in the Bastille.

At the time, the strict rules of semiotics, mirroring those of linguistics, were seen by Kristeva as part of a \"scientific\" logic ', 'rative18 and signification in the second degree (Barthes 1972) marks the movement of a text away from being understood as a static, author-owned product. At around the time of the coining of intertextuality by Kristeva came Barthes\\' (1977) claim: We [...]\" meaning (the \"message\" of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture, (p. 146) The movement from a static, synchronic understanding of text in and of itself to this more diachronic but not traditionally historical view allows 16 This is seen in various forms in Barthes\\' S/Z: An Essay , and the inclusion of the \"voice of science\" (Barthes 1974, 21).

The response, however, was not. Occurring at a time when the Scythians still used material symbols rather than the written word to represent ideas, Idanthyrsus, ruler of Scythia, responded to Darius’s threat by sending him five objects: a frog, a mouse, a', 'ainst the preeminence of authors as sole arbiters of meaning in the production of their work.29 For Barthes, the displacement of the author was necessary in order to liberate the text from its existence as a bounded system of meanings. He wrote, \"To [...].\"30 In signaling the \"Death of the Author,\" Barthes opens the text to a potentially infinite number of interpretations. He maintained that the text should exist as a \"multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash.\"31 Barthes advocated polysémie readings of texts, but in order for this to be actualized, the author, a historically, culturally, and psychologically bounded figure, first had to be deposed. Barthes even went so far as to state that \"the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author.\"32 But are the two in fact mutually exclusive categories? Two active, though not necessarily competing, forces are at work in Barthes\\'s essay: the act of writing and the act of rea', ' if we maintain that these complements to work are essential to its understanding, Malevich\\'s The Non-Objective World, Mondrian\\'s Plastic Art and Pure Plastic Art, Kandinsky\\'s Concerning the Spiritual in Art ... , remain statements and not texts: \"a [...].\"12 Smithson\\'s writings, on the other hand, are indeed texts, dazzling orchestrations of multiple, overlapping voices; as such, they participate in that displacement of literature by the activity of writing which also occurs with Barthes, Derrida, Lacan. . ... This is not, however, the only value of these texts, for they also reveal the degree to which strategies which must be described as textual have infiltrated every aspect of contemporary aesthetic production. In his 1973 review of a Frederick Law Olmsted exhibition at the Whitney Museum, Smithson observes that \"the maps, photographs, and documents in catalogue form ... are as much a part of Olmsted\\'s art as the art itself\" (p. 119.)-which might be applied with equal validity to Smiths', 'thes, for instance, announces \"the death of the author,\" and contends that, with the displacement of the author\\'s authority, we can no longer presume an end point or closure for our interpretations. \"Once the author is removed,\" Barthes states, \"the [...].\"3 In Structuralist Poetics, Jonathan Culler also disputes the authority of the author, and bases his theory on the conventions that make reading possible. But for Culler, the reader is no more a free agent than the author. \"The subject who reads,\" he states, \"is constituted by a series of conventions, the grids of regularity and intersubjectivity. The empirical T is dispersed among these conventions which take over from him in the act of reading.\"4 Stanley Fish, like Culler, is best known for his emphasis on the reader, but perhaps the most radical feature of his theory is its redefinition of the text. In Fish\\'s view, the text has no independent status, not even in its formal features (periods, commas, and the like).

Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1966). Among the recent literary studies advancing the now-familiar idea that early modern ideologies of order and degree were not necessarily hegemonic, see Stephen Greenblatt, \"Invisible Bullets,\" Shakespearean Negotiations: The Circulation of Social Energy in Renaissance England, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 21-65; Jonathan Dollimore, Radical Tragedy: Reli', 'ject of reading is not to discover the mind of the author, but to generate meaning\" (p. xxvii).

What our analysis reveals is that Pym is constructed within the pervasive influence of the sublime. The \"abyss of heterogeneity\"30 that Poe depicts points both to the infinite expansion of meaning inherent in the sublime and to the problematics of representation typical of Postmodernism.

According to Roland Barthes, the conventional view of the reading process involves the notion of \"a before and an after ,\" with an Author \"[...]\" and the reader as an after-effect of that past (145). Barnes\\'s intertextual method operates to destroy this kind of linearity. Because she posits no single or first creator, readers are left in the position of trying to understand Ryder without a clear guide or source. Moreover, insofar as the traditional Elizabethan models she invokes usually contained just such a guide, Ryder does not conform to the standards of the very works it imitates. Instead, it becomes unruly, toying with its readers and their expectations. First, Barnes seduces us into looking and mocks our gaze. Second, she explains the seduction by revealing its structure of deception.

And yes, something different could always be said about the text, which would ignore this trace and insist on that trace; something more could always be written which would feature one additional trace—which means that the text is doomed always to be different from itself (which is also the text’s opportunity always to remain current).164 In the 161.

Judith Butl', \"ong. The song certainly is heroic, it has something epic about it, but I also find it boastful, funny and ironic. It in no way minimises the awfulness of mining as Harker suggests. Whatever the intentions of the songwriter, (for every text is 'but a [...] and clash'3), I think Harker is guilty of trying to foist on the reader the meanings and responses the song creates for him as somehow the eternal meanings inscribed in the song. He writes: 'for all its self-deprecating manner, the song is a hymn to the horrors and degradation of pitwork over the centuries'. My response to the song is very different. 'Without the fine tune and jaunty singing style' writes Harker, 'the text comes across as unselfconsciously moronic'. So much for the analysis of song as an integrated idiom! Harker, who so emphasises the importance of context, is willing to rip the text from its context of melody and performance in order to pass judgement. Here we have the Cambridge Eng. Lit. student disregarding the bit he f\", 'ly the authorial narrator but the author as well. Consequently, he favored first person narration, authorial narration ostensibly propagating a pernicious lie. In \"The Death of the Author\" he identified his project as an \"anti-theological\" gesture, \"[...]?rea son, science, law\" (147). Barthes\\' experience as a reader was what he called a \"revo lutionary act\" (147): he was resisting a conception of God?the only conception of God he allowed: God as tyrant. Culler\\'s own resistance also seems to me more theological than literary. For in stance, while he decides not to call omniscience \"obscene,\" it is nearly so to him, smacking of arrogance and a Bush-like imperialism. He has a particular view of God?or a particular view of what others must be referring to when they use \"God\" or a godlike analogy. For him, as for Barthes, \"God\" inevitably suggests the abuse of power. But for Barthes it was impossible to focus on authorial artistry to the exclu sion of ideology. Indeed, he proclaimed authorial ar', 'e maker\\'s role, donning that of chronicler. Henry Fielding\\'s narra tor, on the other hand, is \"an unmarked case,\" though a highly self-conscious one, fully aware that he can at whim \"rescue Tom Jones from jail.\" 2.

Bellatin trades in this currency by including two source shortstories at the end of the book, first an anonymous short story named \"La nariz\" from the thirteenth century about a monk with an enormous nose that the story of Nagaoka Shiki reproduces as his life in the monastery. Following this is a short story also named \"La nariz\" by Akutagawa Rynosuke from 1916 that is also a retelling of the anonymous short story. Because Bellatin provides the Japanese source stories that he copies and embellishes in his fiction, the text becomes a meta-text where Barthes analysis seems to be made manifest that de-authored copied texts \"blend and clash.\" Another part of Barthes\\' work incorporated into the ', 'jemplo, las referencias b?blicas o a los cl?sicos de Alonso y Otero.

Against such conviction, various means of saving the text, if not the author, have of course been proposed. Marshall W. Alcorn, Jr., acknowledges the impact of recent theory: One consequence of post-structuralist theory seems to be that it is no longer possible to assume the presence of an \"objective\" text. The text cannot be objective because, if it is considered as the encoding of an author\\'s message, the text cannot remain tied to the integrity of its originating or controlling purpose. It loses its message as it is violated by reading strategies. If we dismiss the importance of the author and think of the text as an autonomous linguistic artifact, the text still cannot exist as an objective entity, for it cannot control and del', ' of popular music yet again.1 That same year, Roland Barthes famously proclaimed the \"death of the author,\" concluding that prevailing Renaissance-era notions of author ship were no longer germane?and perhaps had never been so in the first place.The [...],\" Barthes asserts, and textual creation equals writerly death, as well as the moment in which readerly reception commences (1977, 142).

In so doing, they succeeded in establishing a conflicted historical record that, by virtue of its own contradictory?and, at times, antagonistic? nature reinforces popular, fan-friendly mythologies about the', '[...]. Roland Barthes, \"The Death of the Author\" Gender and Genre THE CONVENTIONS OF THE EPISTOLARY NOVEL, more than those of any other genre, require authors to mask their own gender in order to give voice to characters of both sexes. That these conventions succeed in lending full authority to the voices of the fictive correspondents is only too evident from the history of readers\\' and critics\\' reactions to epistolary novels. The most notorious example that comes to mind is the longstanding controversy over the authorship of The Letters of the Portuguese Nun, published anonymously in 1669 by the editor of a self-proclaimed French \"translator\" of the \"found\" letters. The Letters sparked off a debate between readers who, believing in the authenti', 'ld remain mute\" (Richter 928). Roland Barthes, however, takes a more radical stance by destabilizing and, more so, negating the concept of \"author.\" According to Barthes, the author\\'s death is automatic, occurring when writing begins. At this point \"[...]\" (142). To Barthes, the \"scriptor\" is merely the hand that is informed by language; thus language precedes the text and serves as its origin. At the death of the author, both the text and the reader are free of the constraints and limitations associated with the \"author-function.\" In advocating the author\\'s demise, Barthes also desacralizes or reduces the authority that is normally vested in the title \"Author.\" For Barthes, \"Author\" is a construct that makes us see a text as \"univocal and originating or emanating from a singular, unified source\" (Childers and Hentzi \"Author\"). Hence the authorial presence restricts the freedom of both text and reader; but with the \"death\" of the author, the functions of both text and reader are redefined. ', 'des to the facts of Williams\\'s life \"only insofar as they help illuminate the works\" (xi). Barthes and other poststructuralists would question whether the author\\'s presence \"illuminates\" or limits our reading of the text. According to Barthes, \"[t]o [...].\" Hence, as Barthes continues, \"when the author has been found, the text has been \\'explained\\' \" (147). Barthes\\'s aim is to delimit meaning, thereby \"refusing to assign a \\'secret,\\' an ultimate meaning, to the text\" (147). While Barthes\\'s concept of the author is couched in poststructuralist theories that wrest control of meaning from the author, Foucault reminds us that \"the \\'authorfunction\\' is not universal or constant in all discourse\" (125). For example, \"stories, folktales, epics, and tragedies were [and still are] accepted, circulated, and valorized without any question about the identity of their author\" (Foucault 125). Good examples of these texts are the Greek classics: the Odyssey; the Iliad (the claim that Homer is the author is s', 'y students; how a text is used in the L2 classroom and the significance that it might have for L2 learners do not contribute to its authenticity. This idea is not supported by post-structuralist theory, however. As Barthes (1977) explains, “a text’s [...]” (148). This means that no matter the context of a text’s creation or the intentions of an author (i.e, its origin), the final determination of meaning and significance of a text is made by the reader (i.e., its destination). This post-structuralist conceptualization of texts is at the core of Guerrettaz and Johnston’s (2013) influential study on the use of textbooks in the classroom. Echoing Barthes (1977), these scholars explain why a text’s value cannot be determined based solely on the purpose for which it \\n 248 Hispania 102 June 2019 was created: “once an artifact such as a textbook leaves the hands of its designer(s) and is actually used in the world, it often provides affordances that were not intended or perhaps even imagined by th', \"an earnest professor at Jonathan Swift's Academy of Lagado.)

C. Carlier, gives clear and unifying focus to the multiplicity of 'The Death of the Author' by explaining that it is a satiric tour de force , Barthes's essay itself forbids anyone to contradict him. No plaintive protestation that 'such a meaning was not intended', nor any appeal to statements made elsewhere by Barthes, could ever suffice to refute the Garlier reading. Indeed, such a protestation and such an appeal would be a betrayal of the literal meaning of 'The Death of the Author', and would show that even those readers who purport to believe what it overtly says are, after all, its traducers, poignantly cli\", 'he legitimacy of literature; neither the mere existence of the term, nor the fact that a whole university system is based upon it, can of itself justify its acceptance.\"10 C.

This presence is just as indeterminate because these \\'texts\\' are not addressed to any particular public....

Recently, considerable attention has been focused on another locus of the object subject axis, namely, the relations be tween the text and the spectator. This discourse has centered around the posi tioning and inscription of the subject through linguistic, id', 's, gives pleasure, but rarely does it take responsibil- 3 ity.

Conrad tells us that if Youth had 11 been a matter of “sincere colouring,” Heart of Darkness demanded “another art 12 altogether”: “It had to be given a sinister resonance, a tonality of its own, a 13 continued vibration that, I hoped, would hang in the air and dwell on the ear 14 long after the last note had been struck” (Youth xi).

Barthes\\' theory questioned not only the legitimacy of an author-orien ted hermeneutics, but also the entire etiology of \"the author\". For him, there is a crucial distinction to be made between pre-modernist and mod ernist literature: that between the \"readerly\" and the \"writerly\" text. Read erly - usually pre-modernist - texts rely upon shared conventions between writer and reader, such as closure or the tying up of strands of the narrative at its end, which encourage the reader to be passive, whereas writerly - commonly modernist - texts flout those conventions and require the reader to be more productive of the text\\'s meanings, which are usually ambiguous.

Visual History and Nation In Guha-Thakurta and Pinney, identification and othering are effective scholarly strategies for approaching the recalcitrant, braided lives of human and material practices that are both embedded in the visual and textual archives of modern India and invisible in the heat and glare of current public and popular politics. However, they are strategi', 'ally: \"work\" to suggest an aesthetic, symbolic whole sealed by an origin (i.e., the author) and an end (i.e., a represented reality or transcendent meaning); and \"text\" to suggest an aaesthetic, \"multidimensional space in which a variety ofwritings, [...].\"\\'2 The difference between the two rests finally on this: for the work the sign is a stable unit of signifier and signified (with the referent assured or, in abstraction, bracketed), whereas the text reflects on the contemporary dissolution of the sign and the released play of signifiers. For our purposes, however, only two questions are important here: How does the postmodernist text differ from the modernist work as a model of discourse? And how does (poststructuralist) textuality differ from (neoconservative) pastiche as a form of representation? After the failure of utopian, protopolitical modernism (e.g., Constructivism, the Bauhaus) on the one hand, a new model of modernism was needed. There were other pressures as well: the diaspora', 'on) \"the prestige of the individual.\"3 Michel Foucault gives a slightly fuller ac count in his essay \"What Is an Author?\" noting two features of the author\\'s history. First, in apparent agreement with Barthes\\' characteriza tion of the author as \"the [...]\" (p. 143), Foucault says: it was at the moment when a system of ownership and strict copy right rules were established (toward the end of the eighteenth and 131 \\n beginning of the nineteenth century) that the transgressive prop erties always intrinsic to the act of writing became the forceful im perative of literature.4 The intrinsic transgressive properties of writing result from its being \"an action situated in a bipolar field of sacred and profane, lawful and unlawful, religious and blasphemous\" (p. 124). It only came to be con sidered a product or possession to be \"assigned real authors\" instead of mythical or religious figures when \"the author became subject to punish ment\" (p. 124). The second feature Foucault points out is that the ', 'act that \"in our day, literary works are totally dominated by the sovereignty of the author\" (Foucault, p. 126). Barthes makes this his first real criticism. After only an introduc tory paragraph and brief hints at the author\\'s history, he says: The [...] ... (p. 143) 132 \\n The attempt to dethrone the author, though, is hardly new with Barthes. It is easy to find examples of this project in many earlier twentieth-century critics. For instance, T. S. Eliot said, \"The progress of an artist is a con tinual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality.\"5 To the New Critics, the \"intentional fallacy\" was a mortal sin. And Northrop Frye says in Anatomy of Criticism: The absurd quantum formula of criticism, the assertion that the critic should confine himself to \"getting out\" of a poem exactly what the poet may vaguely be assumed to have been aware of \"putting in,\" is one of the many slovenly illiteracies that the absence of systematic criticism has allowed to grow up. This quantum theory', 'who have tried to loosen \"the sway of the Author,\" beginning with Mallarm?, who, Barthes says, recognized that \"it is language which speaks, not the author\" (p. 143). The reference is to the act of writing, for Barthes continues, \"to write is ... to [...],\\' and not \\'me\\' \" (p. 143). Barthes cites as further examples Val?ry and Proust, then mentions Sur 142 \\n realism, which \"contributed to the desacrilization of the image of the Author by ceaselessly recommending the abrupt disappointment of expec tations of meaning (the famous surrealist \\'jolt\\'), by entrusting the hand with the task of writing as quickly as possible what the head itself is unaware of\" (p. 144). Again, the focus is on the act of writing. Here, though, the focus begins to shift. Barthes says that modern linguistics has shown that \"the whole of enunciation is an empty process, functioning perfectly without there being any need for it to be filled with the person of the interlocutors\" (p. 145). Barthes takes this to mean that th', 'ference is to the act of writing, for Barthes continues, \"to write is ... to reach that point where only language acts, \\'performs,\\' and not \\'me\\' \" (p. 143).

The author is no longer \"the past of his own book.\" The temporality of writing is different; \"every text is eternally written here and now.\" This means that Barthes is free to conflate writing (act) and writing (what is written); there is no longer any difference.

Julia Kristeva defines intertextuality by suggesting that multiple texts exist and operate in relation to others. Roland Barthes similarly argues that a media text is “a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings [...] [...]” (1977, 48). In other words, in seeing intertextuality as an expansion of story across different texts, as Daniela Caselli (2006, 49) proposes, intertextuality creates a scenario in which the meaning of a story may be built in relation not only to the individual story in question but also in relation to other stories that are invoked in the reading process. The same principle underpins the world building of early Disney. Martin Rubin has argued that the “tendency toward explicit intertextuality reached its most intense and overt form in the 1930s” (1990). Rubin in fact claims that intertextuality helped to create distinctive cartoon stars precisely via “topical references to popular songs, sayings, movies, plays, radio shows, books, magazi', 'he language of the society in which I live ... the very images and concepts are the images and concepts of those who hear me; but the sap, the life-giving sap . .. that sap which cannot be seen, this is mine.

The device of the manuscript found by chance, the use of symbolic language, the intrusion of the historical Unamuno in his work, and the development of character, all share in common the propensity towards apocopation. In combination, these narrative strategies become an organizing center that allows Unamuno to construct an art of apoco', \" 'The Death of the Author', although, significantly, nobody had thought to apply Barthes's views to the issues we were discussing.

But even in the case of anonymous periodical criticism the con stituting traces include the elements that tradition ally go under the rubric of authorship. In the case of Smith, his habitual \"poetizing\" of the poet and his arguments for the validity of meditative poe try as a form of action are concerns that he carries from the pages of the radical Westminster to the Tory Blackwood!s, and his criticism is shaped by his reticent personality.

To understand the significance of the satire of the critics in the Epilogue, it might be useful to remind ourselves that Shaw was not a popular playwright. He was, it is true, by 191 1 extremely well-known as a dramatist and indeed had made \\n RUSKIN AND FORM IN FANNY\\'S FIRST PLAY 97 money from his plays, but it was only with Pygmalion, written after Fanny\\'s First Play, that he became a fashionable and popular West End author. Up to that time, Shaw had been in the avant garde of the literary movement. As a dramatic critic himself, he had been the champio', 'unmalicious satire on his more obtuse critics as an unanswerable illustration of his abilities. Shaw makes his critics speculate on the identity of the author, only to reveal their own prejudices in the process. This is echoed in Barthes\\'s essay: To [...] beneath the work: when the Author has been found, the text is \"explained\" - victory to the critic.19 Fanny\\'s First Play was a deliberate exercise to show that he could be a popular playwright if he chose, and that if he did not choose, it was because he had more serious concerns on his mind regarding both form and content. In the Preface to Great Catherine, Shaw comments on considerations of form even for such a piece of what he calls \"apparent tomfoolery\" (4:897) and, significantly, writes of his reluctance to write about such matters: In dragging the reader thus for a moment behind the scenes, I am departing from a rule which I have hitherto imposed on myself so rigidly that I never permit myself, even in a stage direction, to let slip a', 'essay: To give a text an Author is to impose a limit in that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing.

But this is because, for Barthes, the ‹gures of the author and the reader are standing in for different orders of discourse that, in a somewhat polemical way, are being starkly opposed: the Author (with a capital A) stands for an ideology of communication in which agents are at least partly autonomous, and the Author’s opposite number is not the reader, therefore, but the Critic (we are being referred to Barthes’s polemic in the 1960s against “University criticism” and in favor of the French nouvelle critique). The reader, on the other hand, who goes uncapitalized, refers us to a concept of writerliness, or textuality, that is described in this essay as “originless” (its “scriptor” is ', 'anne Korn 579 that they represented a flawed and ambiguous truth; so for myself, I shall be looking for a reading of truth along the lines that “Near Perigord\" suggests to me, hinting that the nature of poetry is—in Barthes\\' words a multidimensional [...]. . . .

He writes: [...] (Barthes, 1968/1977, p. 147). However, Barthes\\' own writing suggests a rather different writer who, while recognising the profusion of ambiguities and interpretations that inhabit the gap between writing and reading, is not without passions and ideas. Barthes\\' writings suggest that the writer and reader are distinct figures who both have a role in the creation of texts. Although artists recognise the differences between art and literature, The death of the author\\' is an important influence on artistic production, in part because, as Michael Newman (1986, pp. 38^-2) argues, it is implicit in artworks such as Marcel Duchamp\\'s readymades.

A reader who could hold together all the traces would be the one who looks the spectacle of death from the tribune and who believes him/herself outside (violence, the text). Indeed most reader-response criticism relies on the binary distinction between the text and the reader looking for one of them to be the source of the true meaning of the text. 2666 disrupts the binary distinction between reader (outside) and text (inside), not just by erasing the difference but by showing how the outside is already inside the text, and while opening the possibility of a transcendental reading - such as that of morally alert criticism - it destabilizes it at the same time.

Thus, in moving from work to textfrom author to writer-there are no secret meanings for the reader to discover. The text becomes the occasion for \"critical readings.\" While Barthes develops a compelling picture of the reader and writer entwined within a web of textuality, too much, according to Pollock, is left unexplained. First of all, \"The Death of the Author\" provides no opening for relating the social conditions of production to historical writers. If the writer or', 'ed our desire to establish the value of the text so as to ascribe \"holiness\" to its author/ The period that followed the Middle Ages saw the transformation of the institution of authorship as a lawful enteiprise into an enterprise of property value. [...] and the turn towards personal faith in the Reformation period - all contributed to the recognition of the personal values of the individual and the idea of the \"human person.\"4 In the literary field, this ideology has manifested itself in the positivist search for the writer\\'s personality, his individuality and human self. The privileged position that the author occupies in our society is a remnant of that old theological dogma that still governs our thinking. At the same time, the insistence on the author\\'s presence has been intricately interwoven into the relationship between speech and writing. Since the time of Plato, writing has always been on trial, always accused of its subversive tactics with respect to speech. Speech, through its ', 'eporting what she thinks as well as what she sees. The anaphoric sequence of sentences beginning \"She liked\" (lines 28-31) affects us as being a transcription rather than a description of her thoughts because they could be transposed into monologue ([...]) without any illogicality or stylistic awkwardness. Sentences in free indirect speech, \"The cat would be round to the right. Perhaps she could go along under the eaves\" (33-4) and \"of course, the hotel-keeper had sent her\" (36-7), mark the maximum degree of identification of the narration with the wife\\'s point of view. When she returns to the room the narration separates itself from her again. There is a lot of direct speech from now on, no report of the wife\\'s thoughts, and occasionally the narration seems to adopt the husband\\'s perspective alone, e.g., \"George looked up and saw the back of her neck, clipped like a boy\\'s\" (70), and - very importantly: Someone knocked on the door. \"Avanti,\" George said.

Barthes conceived of these traces as an intertextual tissue of quotations, but this was not something that narratology could countenance, beyond a flirtation with Bakhtinian heteroglossia restricted largely to the study of Free Indirect Discourse. By shifting the producing activity of narrative from the text to the process of reception, we allow “that someone” known as the “real” reader to hold together all the traces of narrative theory dissipated by the Derridean trace. Narrative Voice after Deconstruction To demonstrate the legacy of the “trace” in postclassical narratology, I will look briefly at two books published in 1996 which exemplify directions narrative theory could take in response to deconstruction: Andrew Gibson’s Tow', 'our extra-theatrical activities. \"37 We view an artwork with all of our visual and cultural memory, our intellectual and moral faculties (at our best) in full alertness.

The ‘I’ on which autobiography and subjectivity depend is transformed into words, text, the signature of authorial identity. Tuqan’s A Mountainous Journey, a narrative of defiance and criticism of Palestinian patriarchal society, foregrounds the issues of women’s speech, silence and sacrifice, almost as a companion piece to Lady Lumley’s Iphigenia.

Societies can find in them their shared belief in the importance of liberty, even if they would have a hard time putting into words what liberty should actually amount to.

In no small measure is this due to Jacques Derrida. If human reality can be conceived and read as a text without boundaries, so can the self. This de-bordement of textuality, Derrida says, \"forces us to extend the accredited concept, the dominant notion of a \\'text\\' [to] . . . everything that was to be set up in opposition to writing (speech, life, the world, the real, history, and what not, every field of reference - to body or mind, conscious or unconscious, politi', ' attempt to formulate a new \"American\" way of life. An early post-structuralist approach can help us appreciate the conflicting multiple tensions in this novel. In \"The Death of the Author,\" Roland Barthes argues that a \"text\" is a \"multidimensional [...]\" (146). Upon close examination of George MELUS, Volume 23, Number 1 (Spring 1998) \\n HECTOR PEREZ Washington Gomez, what we find are ideology charged textual strands, layered and intersecting, that recall various cultural elements available to the novel\\'s narrative consciousness at the time of construction. The radical border corrido and conservative La Prensa are two cultural elements that influenced the ways in which the Texas Mexican community perceived itself. Americo Paredes, a member of that community, was also an intellectual with literary aspirations whose worldview was further influenced by American naturalism.1 The border corrido, La Prensa, and American naturalism, then, represent influences on the author and consequently in the ', 'y into a literary one: author-reader. In one of the seminal texts of poststructuralist thought - \"The Death of the Author\" - Roland Barthes undermined the determinacy of meaning within any text procured through appeal to the author. For Barthes, \"to [...]\" (Barthes 1992, p.l 17). The key argument in this essay established that the location of \\'a\\' meaning (never \\'the\\' meaning) for any text was not to be found with an author but rather with the reader. In other words, the origin of meaning resided in the act (or performance) of reading itself. \"There is no other time than that of the enunciation\", declared Barthes, \"and every text is eternally written here and now \" (Barthes 1 992, p. 1 1 6). Set within the context of any sign-system, Barthes\\' death of the author becomes paradigmatic (8). If we are seeking to understand how meaning is produced in any event, we must look not to the script but to the performance, and ultimately to the most integral dimension of any performance: the audience. It', 'he university, and most importantly by the loss of laughter. Marxist discourse has been for the most part subsumed into the academy while psychoanalysis needed little encouragement to adopt the attire of the professional. By contrast, Ellis\\'s use of [...] narration, his provocative collapsing of the distinctions between the author, narrator, and protagonist, as well as his choice of controversial subject matter is a deliberate challenge to respectability that constitutes a powerful form of \"kynicism.\" The kynic then, is someone who shrugs off the air of respectability in order to confront the discourse of the ruling (or mercantile) classes with vulgarity, triviality, and laughter. Sloterdijk\\'s project is to reignite the satiric tradition in Western philosophy, beginning with the reinvigoration of Diogenes\\'s laughter, which he sees as the primary expression of kynicism. According to Zizek, who provided one of the first Anglophone commentaries on Sloterdijk\\'s work in The Sublime Object of Ide', 'e echoed both by Serena (see 89) and Tom Haley, the latter voicing a legitimate concern that \"this is how these secret bureaucracies perpetuate themselves. . . . It\\'s right out of Kafka\" (261–62). \\n Savu Walker 513 11. Having defined writing as the \"[...]\" (142), Roland Barthes sought to replace the sovereignty of \"the Author\" with that of the reader-critic, one \"without history, biography, psychology\" (148). Similarly, Foucault\\'s concept of the author-function presupposed the \"total effacement of the individual characteristics of the writer\" (117) by the \"anonymous murmuring of the collective discourse\" (138). 12. Wilson\\'s conclusion reinforces Seàn Burke\\'s reformulation of the \"what-question\" posed by Foucault as the \"who-question\" he necessarily suppressed (360). 13.

This uncanny experience is a reading experience, an experience of deja lu. As such it is housed in the readers\\' subjectivity, \"the space,\" in Barthes\\'s words, \"on which [...]\" (1977: 148). The coincidence, within that space, of the recognition of a particular hypotext and an awareness of the textual compulsion to repeat it, elicits an eerie interruption. The compulsion to return to the earlier novel may be seen as an effect of the anxiety of influence, a battleground for asserting will and originality against the oppressive force of Conrad\\'s detested precursor. The novel, moreover, offers a performative re-enactment of this rivalry in the staging of a similar interruption of the life of its protagonist. Haldin\\'s invasion of Razumov\\'s life recasts this batde in the diegesis. Such mirroring may be used in formulating a viable interpretation of the text: Under Western Eyes may be viewed as a programmatic transposi', 'specifically to the announcement of the \"death of the author,\" signaled most emphatically by Roland Barthes (1977). Arguing, like Foucault (1984), that the notion of the author was very much a construction of modernity, Barthes (1977) states that \"a [...]\" (p. 146). \"[T]o give writing its future,\" Barthes argues, \"it is necessary to overthrow the myth: the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author\" (p. 148). Barthes suggests that by doing away with the notion of the author, writing can no longer be seen as an act of representation, and meaning can no longer be attached to some authorial intent. Linking this idea to speech act theory, he suggests that all writing is nothing but \"a performative,\" having \"no other content ... than the act by which it is uttered\" (p. 146).4 If this line of thinking raises many questions about authorship, Swan\\'s (1994) discussion of Helen Keller\\'s supposed plagiarism starts to raise different postmodernist issues concerning the body and ', 'ture;26 ultimately, however, it is subsumed within those discourses. 27 An imagined rivalry between the Critic and the Author animates Barthes\\'s position; their dispute takes place over the bodies of historical authors on the field of the text. \"The [...].... The explanation of a work is always sought in the man or woman who produced it, as if it were always in the end, through the more or less transparent allegory of the fiction, the voice of a single person, the author \\'confiding\\' in us.\"28 Barthes\\'s conclusion indicates that the outcome ought to redress, if not invert, the relationship of Author to Critic: \"A text\\'s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination....

Because it is so obscure, so deliberately hidden, a secret utterance may be given radically different meanings, depending on its context-depending on which Guru is interpreting it, to whom he is revealing it, in what context, at what stage of initiation, in which historical period or social milieu he is speaking, and so forth. Hence, it is not simply the case that secret discourse is semantically \"empty\" or devoid of any content; it is not a kind of \"McGuffin,\" to use Alfred Hitchcock\\'s metaphor.85 83 Paul Ricoeur', '[...] on any one of them.

We are thus invited to add our own ', 'ld not only contradict Simmel\\'s notion of the artistic work\\'s transcendent Wertakzent , but, as Barthes suggests, it would \"liberate[] an activity we might call countertheological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to halt meaning is finally, to [...]\" (54). * * * 46 \\n Yet, lest Job\\'s pleas for the \"ground\" of God\\'s anger and the \"book\" of his adversary (KJV 31:35) become nothing but \"eloquent expression\" (to repeat Daiches), liberation from theology, or rhetorical jouissance , his pleas attempt not only to transgress the boundaries of tradition backwards but attempt also to transgress their self-referential, rhetorical nature forwards. It is only, I think, for such, attempted referentiality, backwards and forwards, that we read the book at all. I doubt that perpetual deferral and intransitive openness can constitute a sufficient motive for reading or for critical commentary. In commenting on the Book of Job we do not (only) rejoice in its playful ambiguity or the lack of a solution, bu', 'that can constitute the greatest danger to white, western, male hegemony by challenging the freely circulating racial fictions in which western systems of knowledge, power, and dominance are grounded.

Although Barthes, like Foucault, represents writing as \"the destruction of every voice, of every point of origin,\" both locate the \"origin\" of the death of the author in the \"voice\" of Mallarme, perhaps thinking of his words in the essay \"Variations on a Subject\" (\"Variations sur un sujet\"): \"The pure work involves the disappearance of the poet\\'s voice, ceding the initiative to the words mobilized by the clash of their dis', \"[...]. (Barthes 148) For decades cin?astes have searched for the complete Greed. Let the search end. The complete Greed is found, it surrounds us. The complete Greed is longer and larger than imagined. More than 10 reels of film, it includes Stroheim's legend in all its fact and fancy. The Finler edition of the script is part of Greed, along with Norris' McTeague, as well as the commentaries of Bazin, Weinberg, Koszarski, Wolfe, and others. Let us even acknowledge Irving Thalberg, the producer, his role in the complete Greed, and those villains with scissors and glue, June Mathis and Joseph Farnham. The complete Greed is an ex panding point of exchange in film history that has served as a focus for rage and meditation for those who love cinema, \", 'language is always a shared process of borrowing and lending—an exchange and “recycling of discourse,” as Susan Seizer has also indicated (64). Along the same lines, Roland Barthes observes in his famous essay “Death of the Author” that a text “is a [...]. [It] is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumberable centres of culture” (146). Our language is constantly in communication with others, in a never-ending process of interpenetration and exchange. If language is already composed of myriad voices with unique intentions and perspectives, then the act of translation is a specifi c form of language creation; it is original writing, equally imbued with creative and subjective ambitions. Through this dialogical or even heteroglot lens, Tieck’s translations open up as acts of verbal performance. Tieck’s reinscription of the dialogical form in her translations through the use of direct speech by the lyrical “I” to the addressee creates a new plane of speech alongside that of Shakespeare.

More to the point, Barthes’ theory, partly articulated in the title of his essay, rejects the cult of authorship promoted by writers like Wordsworth in favour of an understanding of creative production as a networked, relational activity. Clearly, I f ind Barthes’ poststructuralist spin on creative production more convincing than Wordsworth’s Romantic meditation on spontaneous overflows. My interest,', 'rporates a multitude of linear and nonlinear forms and genres and in many ways can be categorized as a hybrid text. Filled with allusions to literary, cultural, and philosophical texts, Virgil Russell sometimes literalizes Barthes’s assertion that a [...]” (128). The first half of the text comprises a collection of stories that seep into each other, giving way in the second half to a seemingly linear plot about the father’s exploits in a nursing home. At the center of the novel is the father-son writing team, serving at once as each other’s writers and audience, a conceit that Everett pushes to the point that the two begin to blur. Virgil Russell thus posits a relational model of authorship on the most intimate scale built on moments of connection between two people. Everett foregrounds this single relationship between the father and son storytellers and then expands it, demonstrating how this intimate form of writing then gestures outward to incorporate larger temporal and generic frames t', 'bly linked in his mind. 9 Tolkien\\'s literary practice stands at odds with recent theoretical pronouncements about \"the death of the author.\" Roland Barthes (170), for example, will not allow that the author expresses insight into what he writes: \"We [...].\" Tolkien also discouraged reductively empiricist or \"authorized\" readings of his work: \"As for any inner meaning or \\'message,\\' it has in the intention of the author none\" (Foreword to The Lord of the Rings, 10). At the same time, he cordially disliked allegory in all its manifestations, preferring history, true or feigned, precisely because it tallied with the thought and experience of readers: \"I think that many confuse \\'applicability\\' with \\'allegory\\'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author\" (Foreword, 11). Accordingly, he did not privilege his own post scriptum interpreta tions over those of other readers, finding them all in the end \"quite amusing\" (Letters, 211). Openne', 'ticle for Leibowitz. Tolkien, on the other hand, revitalizes the idea of the author as scribe, a collaborator wi th the plot devised by the One for the human Story, not a conspirator against it as he is for Barthes (171): by refusing to assign.. .an [...], law, science. Needless to say, Tolkien does not share Barthes\\' anti-theological bias, not least because it would lead to a vast \"library of Babel,\" as in Borges\\' short story, containing all possible books and all possible commentaries but with no reference either to an origin or to a telos, and with no one interpretation claiming authority over the others. I have assumed, with Tolkien (and E.D. Hirsch), that there exists a certain validity in interpretation. As opposed to an infinitely self referential, and even solipsistic, library of Babel that would result in the death of meaning, Tolkien\\'s (and Donne\\'s) open-ended library in the transcendent order would bring about a hermeneutic \"recovery.\" Works Cited Aristotle.

The message seems to be the following: Real meaning may be found in social activity, that is, work outside the home, but your duties also lie elsewhere. Fortunately, the state [...] necessary nuisance more tolerable. If this formulation seems extreme, it is less so than the conclusions reached by the narratives examined in this chapter. These stories and novels undertake a radical interrogation of the roles and duties imposed on women (and, as we will see, on men) in East German socialist society. The fi rst set of texts, all taken from the 1975 anthology Blitz aus heiterm Himmel (Bolt from the Blue), puts the universalist utopianism of socialist ideology to the test. The anthology’s stories of gender turmoil ask, what happens to interpersonal relationships, especially erotic relationships, when the variable of gender difference is changed?

We are now beginning to be the dupes no longer of such antiphrases, by which our society proudly champions precisely what it dismisses, [...] its future we must reverse the myth: the birth of the reader must be ransomed by the death of the author.\" Barthes and other structuralists are saying that critical attention should shift from the techniques of the author to the mental perceptions of the reader. Perhaps it is the only way experimental novels can be understood. By championing his rights to a good read then, Mr. Seltzer may commit a critical error. He spends ten chapters discussing in detail works of writers such as Sterne, Conrad, Beckett, Burroughs, and Genet (without saying much new about them), and only two general polemical ones treating readers and their experiences with texts. Although those two chapters are the most interesting in the book, they are not detailed enou', 'style as a unique invention, the two artists approached closely the whole structure of postmodernism.

The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture.41 The question is, what provided a major stimulus for these artists to formulate this antimodernist formula of creation? It was above all the same urge to justify their independence from Western culture, which in this new, nonauthoritative system of creation would lose its hegemonic role.

It is the return of the death of the author, replaced by what Barthes calls a “[...],” neither “preceding” nor “exceeding” it (145). Perhaps this is the danger of the digital for DeLillo but also its lure? Perhaps this is why Bill Gray must literally die toward the end of Mao II, because he refuses to die symbolically? 1997 “The reason I use a manual typewriter,” DeLillo writes in a letter to David Foster Wallace in 1997, “concerns the sculptural quality I find in words on paper, the architecture of the letters individually and in combination, a sensation advanced (for me) by the mechanical nature of the process— finger striking key, hammer striking page. Electronic intervention would dull the sensuous gratification I get from this process— a gratification I try to soak my prose in” (“Letter to David Foster Wallace,” 1). 2', 'iers becomes a product of reading strategies. Michel Foucault, for example, asserts that those \"aspects of an individual which we designate as an author . . . are projections . . . of our way of handling texts\" (127).
