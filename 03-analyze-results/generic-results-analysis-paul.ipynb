      "displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when\n",
      "alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for\n",

      "make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable;\n",
      "besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the\n",

      "Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and,\n",
      "failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to\n",
      "promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole\n",
      "form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking\n",

      "little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for\n",
      "infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a\n",
      "fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a\n",

      "transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of\n",

      "material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details—the charming\n",
      "prodigality of the chemist—details which would have been eliminated from\n",
      "an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished\n",

      "a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which\n",
      "had and those which had not been 'in bloom'—shewed me that these were\n",
      "petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package had\n",

      "Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she\n",

      "bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and\n",
      "would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life,\n",

      "Combray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in Paris\n",
      "with her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on New Year's\n",
      "Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put a five-franc\n",

      "and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of\n",
      "a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect,\n",
      "framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in\n",
      "its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we\n",
      "could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity,\n",

      "most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward.\n",

      "which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we\n",
      "had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise.\n",
      "We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed\n",

      "(for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites\n",
      "the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh\n",
      "charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would\n",
      "she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so\n",
      "bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was\n",
      "often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her\n",

      "furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led\n",

      "going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had\n",
      "managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress\n",

      "beneficent influences—nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did\n",
      "my great-aunt's gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And\n",
      "certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole\n",
      "from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it,\n",
      "but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a\n",
      "consciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible\n",
      "existence. It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too,\n",
      "that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what\n",
      "she prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an\n",
      "air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful,\n",
      "but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it\n",
      "could play the piano, I am sure it would really _play_.\" And when she\n",
      "gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent\n",
      "inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like\n",
      "hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the\n",
      "outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her\n",
      "lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones\n",
      "of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles,\n",
      "which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were\n",
      "softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher,\n",
      "to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into\n",
      "falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and\n",
      "consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view\n",
      "in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base,\n",
      "which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw\n",
      "these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I\n",
      "would say to myself: \"Good heavens! nine o'clock! I must get ready for\n",
      "mass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt Léonie first,\"\n",
      "and I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the\n",
      "Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the\n",
      "blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass,\n",
      "penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or\n",
      "something, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had,\n",
      "bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up,\n",
      "had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his\n",
      "hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest\n",
      "occasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise,\n",
      "cunning, and success.\n",
      "\n",
      "And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Théodore to bring a\n",
      "larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine\n",
      "weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the\n",
      "steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of 'holy\n",
      "bread,' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp\n",
      "point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and\n",
      "thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother\n",
      "and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the\n",
      "close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet\n",
      "cushion, against—as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded\n",
      "beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had\n",
      "correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds\n",
      "wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate\n",
      "its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the\n",
      "power of words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could\n",
      "not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference\n",
      "to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the\n",
      "houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without\n",
      "the church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen\n",
      "in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with\n",
      "surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by\n",
      "the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman\n",
      "town not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to\n",
      "me and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at\n",
      "them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the\n",
      "gothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses) soars into the sky\n",
      "with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material\n",
      "so different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is\n",
      "at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two\n",
      "pretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the\n",
      "beach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret\n",
      "and gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of\n",
      "the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second,\n",
      "and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet\n",
      "bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the\n",
      "atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact,\n",
      "nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this\n",
      "view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But\n",
      "since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may\n",
      "have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an\n",
      "element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a\n",
      "thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel,\n",
      "so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost\n",
      "life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from\n",
      "the streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o'clock when\n",
      "going to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on\n",
      "the left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops;\n",
      "or again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one's\n",
      "eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther,\n",
      "descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after\n",
      "the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the\n",
      "station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and\n",
      "surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its\n",
      "revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly\n",
      "together and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the\n",
      "effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of\n",
      "heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which\n",
      "dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected\n",
      "pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have\n",
      "been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my\n",
      "confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any\n",
      "large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well,\n",
      "if a passer-by who is 'putting me on the right road' shews me from afar,\n",
      "as a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple\n",
      "lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street\n",
      "which I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to\n",
      "that dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to\n",
      "make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment,\n",
      "oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was\n",
      "obliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for\n",
      "hours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a\n",
      "tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the\n",

      "successful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary\n",

      "Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter\n",

      "from time to time to look after the Curé's linen, or that of some other\n",

      "anyone else, except the reverend Curé. My aunt had by degrees erased every\n",
      "other visitor's name from her list, because they all committed the fatal\n",
      "error, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of\n",

      "which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to\n",
      "take so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and\n",
      "with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or\n",
      "doubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a\n",
      "good red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful\n",
      "sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her\n",

      "who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought,\n",
      "in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those\n",
      "whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable\n",
      "hesitation and at Franchise's urgent request, and who in the course of\n",
      "their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been\n",
      "done them by venturing a timid: \"Don't you think that if you were just to\n",
      "stir out a little on really fine days...?\" or who, on the other hand, when\n",
      "she said to them: \"I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear\n",

      "consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of\n",
      "these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming\n",

      "short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to\n",

      "sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a\n",

      "of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of\n",

      "eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme. Sazerin.\n",

      "regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent\n",
      "them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those\n",
      "days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at\n",
      "once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie\n",
      "were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of\n",
      "waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from\n",
      "looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms\n",
      "in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end\n",
      "of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her\n",
      "ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than\n",
      "this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Françoise would\n",
      "become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go\n",
      "upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But—and this more than ever from the day on\n",
      "which fine weather definitely set in at Combray—the proud hour °f noon,\n",
      "descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a\n",
      "moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have\n",
      "echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in,\n",
      "after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in\n",
      "front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day,\n",
      "and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of\n",
      "eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the\n",
      "table she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add—as the labour of\n",
      "fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets,\n",
      "the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so\n",
      "effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved\n",
      "on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some\n",
      "extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life—a brill,\n",
      "because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she\n",
      "had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with\n",
      "marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast\n",
      "leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be\n",
      "plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner;\n",
      "spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to\n",
      "get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left;\n",
      "raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to\n",
      "come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years;\n",
      "a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond\n",
      "cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf,\n",
      "because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all these had\n",
      "been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more\n",
      "particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of\n",
      "chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Françoise, would\n",
      "be laid before us, light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music,\n",
      "into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to\n",
      "partake of it, saying: \"No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\"\n",
      "would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when\n",
      "an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and\n",
      "material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his\n",
      "signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have\n",

      "then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect\n",
      "again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they\n",

      "would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the\n",

      "would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood\n",

      "awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he\n",

      "with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression\n",

      "doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How\n",
      "could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could\n",
      "not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I\n",

      "prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this\n",
      "woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for\n",

      "reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the\n",
      "least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of\n",
      "the acquaintance I had made at my uncle's I should at the same time\n",
      "transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the\n",
      "introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely\n",
      "different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to\n",
      "form their estimate of my uncle's conduct. My father and grandfather had\n",
      "'words' with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days\n",
      "later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage,\n",
      "Î felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should\n",
      "have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I\n",
      "considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and\n",
      "petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew\n",
      "him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from\n",
      "so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that,\n",
      "in doing so I was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and\n",
      "though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes\n",

      "indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The\n",
      "kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which\n",
      "an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity\n",
      "and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in\n",
      "which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl\n",
      "there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of\n",

      "between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make\n",
      "out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight.\n",
      "The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he\n",
      "was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then,\n",
      "suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city,\n",
      "would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a\n",
      "hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water,\n",

      "without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Méséglise. Françoise\n",
      "and the gardener, having 'made up' their difference, would discuss the\n",
      "line to be followed in case of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you see, Françoise,\" he would say. \"Revolution would be better,\n",
      "because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.\"\n",

      "\"Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward.\"\n",

      "all the railways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, to be sure; so that we shan't get away,\" said Françoise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the gardener would assent, with \"Ay, they're the cunning ones,\" for he\n",
      "would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state\n",
      "attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who\n",
      "would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.\n",
      "\n",

      "and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch\n",
      "the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage\n",
      "of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal\n",
      "tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Combray. And\n",
      "in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule,\n",
      "'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare,\n",
      "festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border\n",
      "of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the\n",
      "beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself\n",
      "has retreated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read\n",
      "in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the\n",
      "commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had\n",
      "brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had\n",
      "this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a\n",
      "wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different\n",
      "background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the\n",
      "figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than\n",
      "myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name\n",
      "of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the _Nuit d'Octobre_, he had burst\n",
      "out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of\n",
      "warning: \"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He\n",
      "is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am\n",
      "bound to admit, natheless,\" he added graciously, \"that he, and even the\n",
      "man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is\n",
      "not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme\n",
      "merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is\n",
      "\n",

      "They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two\n",
      "runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is\n",
      "found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is\n",
      "a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended,\n",
      "it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me,\n",
      "its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle,\n",
      "indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a\n",
      "critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is\n",
      "impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has\n",
      "weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical\n",
      "prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed\n",
      "_Bhagavat_ and the _Lévrier de Magnus_ speaks not falsely, then, by\n",
      "Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of\n",
      "Olympus.\" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to\n",
      "call him, and that he himself called me, \"my master.\" But, as a matter of\n",
      "fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism,\n",
      "being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real\n",
      "existence by giving it a name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch,\n",
      "in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had\n",
      "engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I,\n",
      "if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself)\n",
      "were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened,\n",
      "Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well\n",
      "received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I\n",
      "formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home\n",
      "with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have\n",
      "objected on principle—indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish\n",
      "extraction—had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were\n",
      "not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new\n",
      "friend home without my grandfather's humming the \"O, God of our fathers\"\n",
      "from _La Juive_, or else \"Israel, break thy chain,\" singing the tune\n",
      "alone, of course, to an \"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be\n",
      "afraid of my friend's recognising the sound, and so being able to\n",
      "reconstruct the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often\n",
      "as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only\n",
      "the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen\n",
      "people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?\"\n",

      "\"Dumont, grandpapa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dumont! Oh, I'm frightened of Dumont.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  Archers, be on your guard!\n",
      "  Watch without rest, without sound,\n",
      "\n",
      "and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call\n",
      "out \"On guard! on guard,\" or, if it were the victim himself who had\n",
      "already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather's\n",
      "subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us\n",
      "that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost\n",
      "inaudibly the air of\n",
      "\n",
      "  What! do you hither guide the feet\n",
      "  Of this timid Israelite?\n",
      "\n",
      "or of\n",

      "or, perhaps, of\n",
      "\n",
      "  Yes, I am of the chosen race.\n",
      "\n",
      "These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will\n",
      "whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for\n",
      "other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in\n",
      "with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I\n",
      "can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \"Sir, I am absolutely\n",
      "incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart\n",
      "from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me\n",
      "of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor boy,\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \"your friend is out of\n",
      "his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As if\n",
      "there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when\n",
      "she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped\n",
      "the tears from his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\" she observed to me. \"Why he\n",
      "doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a\n",
      "half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made\n",
      "not the least apology, saying merely: \"I never allow myself to be\n",
      "influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by\n",
      "the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly\n",
      "reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I\n",
      "am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more\n",
      "pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the\n",
      "umbrella and the watch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was,\n",
      "of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they\n",
      "had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my\n",
      "grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either\n",
      "instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive\n",
      "emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct\n",
      "of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our\n",
      "friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have\n",
      "a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in\n",
      "these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred\n",
      "to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more\n",
      "than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to\n",
      "give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit\n",
      "because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection,\n",
      "but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any\n",
      "single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the\n",
      "duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales\n",
      "to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from\n",
      "the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my\n",
      "great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a\n",
      "niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in\n",
      "which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was\n",
      "her next-of-kin, and it was the 'proper thing' to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the\n",
      "insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely\n",
      "meaningless' beauty of _La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë_ tired me more\n",
      "and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with\n",
      "him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he\n",
      "would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same\n",
      "night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great\n",
      "influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more\n",
      "unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there\n",
      "was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone\n",
      "on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that\n",
      "my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger days, and had\n",
      "been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing on so important\n",
      "a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was\n",
      "not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me\n",
      "with extreme coldness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head\n",
      "and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment\n",
      "'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style\n",
      "had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of\n",
      "his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story\n",
      "alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman\n",
      "at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that\n",
      "we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which\n",
      "he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a\n",
      "prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and\n",
      "elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would\n",
      "begin to speak of the \"vain dream of life,\" of the \"inexhaustible torrent\n",
      "of fair forms,\" of the \"sterile, splendid torture of understanding and\n",
      "loving,\" of the \"moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming\n",
      "and venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he would express a whole\n",
      "system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the\n",
      "inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping\n",
      "which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that\n",
      "imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of\n",
      "Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled\n",
      "me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage\n",
      "bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some\n",
      "innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all\n",
      "obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what\n",
      "had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste\n",
      "for uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist\n",
      "philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my\n",
      "having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no\n",
      "longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in\n",
      "one of Bergotte's works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in\n",
      "outline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the 'ideal passage' of\n",
      "Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier,\n",
      "similar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density\n",
      "and volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was by no means Bergotte's sole admirer; he was the favourite writer\n",
      "also of a friend of my mother's, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du\n",
      "Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte's\n",
      "latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a\n",
      "park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that\n",
      "taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally\n",
      "acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and\n",
      "America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement,\n",
      "but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would seem, what Dr.\n",
      "du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I\n",
      "liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and\n",
      "certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such\n",
      "prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and\n",
      "also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was\n",
      "almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his\n",
      "principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some\n",
      "great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off\n",
      "his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer,\n",
      "would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes,\n",
      "remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a\n",
      "rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious\n",
      "when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no\n",
      "precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where\n",
      "it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites\n",
      "also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even\n",
      "disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he\n",
      "spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of\n",
      "pine-forests or of hailstorms, of _Notre-Dame de Paris_, of _Athalie_, or\n",
      "of _Phèdre_, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode\n",
      "and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe\n",
      "contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless\n",
      "to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might\n",
      "have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and\n",
      "especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of\n",
      "seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon\n",
      "some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea,\n",
      "because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed\n",
      "that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon\n",
      "almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no\n",
      "doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from\n",
      "an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced\n",
      "that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected\n",
      "spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to\n",
      "find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own\n",
      "mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity\n",
      "had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be\n",
      "beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte\n",
      "would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I\n",
      "was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so\n",
      "concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of\n",
      "mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later\n",
      "years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some\n",
      "of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to\n",
      "go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in\n",
      "Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I\n",
      "could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety\n",
      "that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my\n",
      "mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life,' I had no\n",
      "time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read!\n",
      "But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really\n",
      "liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were\n",
      "themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but\n",
      "was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon\n",
      "similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of\n",
      "their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and\n",
      "self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for\n",
      "such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare\n",
      "for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I\n",
      "had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family\n",
      "servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of\n",
      "irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother\n",
      "about Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought\n",
      "not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which\n",
      "were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to\n",
      "make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Françoise\n",
      "and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have\n",
      "sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief that he would find them\n",
      "quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own\n",
      "humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I\n",
      "had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in\n",
      "my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the\n",
      "arms of a long-lost father.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and\n",
      "disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any\n",
      "consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my\n",
      "brain, with rather more _dolce_, rather more _lento_ than he himself had,\n",

      "in my favour and said: \"I know him well; if you would like him to write a\n",

      "that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression\n",
      "which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he\n",

      "of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and\n",
      "precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of\n",
      "'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by\n",
      "this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with\n",
      "generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to\n",
      "be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some\n",
      "precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into\n",
      "account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they\n",
      "say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of\n",
      "its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so\n",
      "unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had\n",
      "dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Léon as being of no\n",
      "importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was\n",
      "devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the\n",
      "duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of\n",
      "formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and\n",
      "when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the\n",

      "manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him\n",
      "justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer's\n",
      "admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and by Dr. du\n",
      "Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: \"He has a charming mind,\n",
      "so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little\n",
      "far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the\n",

      "so far as to say \"He is a great writer, he has great talent.\" They did not\n",
      "even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were\n",
      "not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar\n",

      "control over my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her\n",

      "what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to\n",
      "give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she\n",
      "felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's presents,\n",
      "could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account.\n",

      "But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of\n",

      "Françoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning,\n",
      "her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning,\n",
      "my mother said to me: \"Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the\n",
      "other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing,\n",
      "in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip\n",
      "away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her\n",

      "the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower\n",
      "note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the\n",
      "first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just\n",
      "escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she\n",
      "was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or\n",
      "to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and\n",
      "to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of\n",
      "joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life\n",
      "shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with\n",

      "that my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take\n",
      "a walk every day!\" She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was\n",
      "lying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery,\n",
      "and did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and\n",
      "contented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or\n",
      "anyone's else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and\n",
      "heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my\n",
      "aunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include\n",
      "those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical\n",
      "form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the\n",
      "greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as\n",
      "Françoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin,\n",
      "the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my\n",
      "aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her\n",
      "general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so\n",
      "well 'routined' to it, as Françoise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she\n",
      "had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have\n",
      "'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her\n",
      "luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of\n",
      "luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and\n",
      "rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour\n",
      "to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a\n",
      "few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance,\n",
      "followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The\n",
      "return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences,\n",
      "intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and\n",
      "stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the\n",
      "favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which\n",
      "can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a\n",
      "nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic\n",
      "mind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save\n",
      "for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call\n",
      "to one another good-humouredly, cordially, patriotically, \"Hurry up;\n",
      "there's no time to be lost; don't forget, it's Saturday!\" while my aunt,\n",
      "gossiping with Françoise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer\n",
      "than usual, would say, \"You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing\n",
      "that it's Saturday.\" If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled\n",
      "out a watch and said, \"I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\"\n",
      "everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once:\n",
      "\"Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's\n",
      "Saturday?\" And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and\n",
      "reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt Léonie about this absurd\n",
      "mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a\n",
      "change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would\n",
      "blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we\n",
      "were late in starting for our walk, said, \"What, only two o'clock!\"\n",
      "feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of\n",
      "Saint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the\n",

      "on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler\n",
      "had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where\n",
      "only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would\n",

      "which used to cause Françoise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that\n",
      "had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the\n",
      "nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our\n",
      "luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny\n",
      "that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her\n",
      "heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have\n",
      "dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter,\n",
      "and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other's surprise\n",
      "at seeing us already in the dining-room: \"You see, it's Saturday.\" On\n",
      "reaching this point in the story, Françoise would pause to wipe the tears\n",

      "prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom\n",
      "the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to\n",
      "these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long\n",

      "having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not\n",

      "were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves,\n",
      "over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little\n",
      "clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them\n",
      "save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed\n",
      "of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the\n",
      "shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy\n",
      "buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public\n",
      "rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had\n",

      "have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to\n",
      "remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and\n",
      "reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes,\n",
      "however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must\n",
      "see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously\n",
      "closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Françoise's integrity\n",
      "and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would\n",
      "confide in Françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom\n",
      "the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and,\n",
      "disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be 'as thick as\n",
      "thieves' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two\n",
      "would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie\n",
      "might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which\n",
      "must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her\n",
      "in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was\n",
      "Françoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was\n",
      "perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave\n",
      "her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for\n",
      "herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And\n",
      "so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt,\n",
      "at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being\n",
      "concealed from her by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive\n",
      "movement of Françoise's features, something contradictory in what she was\n",
      "saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would\n",
      "shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise\n",
      "turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in\n",
      "driving into her unhappy servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a\n",
      "disclosure by Eulalie—like one of those discoveries which suddenly open\n",
      "up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has\n",
      "hitherto followed only the beaten paths—proved to my aunt that her own\n",
      "worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. \"But\n",
      "Françoise ought to know that,\" said Eulalie, \"now that you have given her\n",
      "a carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\" gasped my aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in\n",
      "her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I\n",
      "supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter,\n",
      "could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices. My\n",
      "mother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my\n",
      "aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that\n",
      "might be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely\n",
      "scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to\n",
      "ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up\n",
      "her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she\n",
      "would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her\n",
      "face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this\n",
      "way—whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth\n",
      "century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would\n",
      "consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed\n",
      "a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when\n",
      "he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of\n",
      "Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking\n",
      "to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere\n",
      "outward forms—a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no\n",
      "more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible\n",
      "eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter\n",
      "idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought\n",
      "to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning\n",
      "toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their\n",
      "despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in\n",
      "what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and\n",
      "was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good\n",
      "humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with\n",
      "matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did\n",
      "the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier,\n",
      "or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the\n",

      "One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé\n",
      "and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole\n",
      "family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole\n",

      "her door at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Léonie,\" she said kindly,\n",
      "\"you have had all your friends here at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And my great-aunt interrupted with: \"Too many good things...\"\n",
      "for, since her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to\n",
      "revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the\n",
      "brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to take advantage,\" he said, \"of the whole family's being\n",

      "again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's bad\n",
      "books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with\n",
      "him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went\n",
      "downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,\n",
      "which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and\n",
      "excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by\n",
      "the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once\n",
      "friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had\n",
      "barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as\n",
      "though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic\n",
      "of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly\n",
      "receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far\n",
      "end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they\n",
      "content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible\n",
      "movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known\n",
      "and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for\n",
      "amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked\n",
      "himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\" he\n",
      "said, \"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is\n",
      "something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties,\n",
      "so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost,\n",
      "which is really attractive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had\n",
      "imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question,\n",
      "had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father's\n",
      "fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned\n",
      "from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on\n",
      "account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came\n",
      "up to us with outstretched hand: \"Do you know, master book-lover,\" he\n",
      "asked me, \"this line of Paul Desjardins?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never\n",
      "read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is\n",
      "converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the\n",
      "most charming water-colour touch—\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even\n",
      "when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all\n",
      "black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself,\n",
      "as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\" He took a cigarette from his\n",
      "pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. \"Goodbye,\n",

      "Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Françoise with\n",

      "in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the\n",
      "world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the\n",
      "asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately\n",

      "from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was\n",
      "serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness\n",
      "predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the\n",

      "those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent\n",
      "confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Françoise, being\n",
      "without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in\n",
      "the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a\n",
      "chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Françoise,\n",
      "beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the\n",

      "prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its\n",
      "appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious\n",
      "juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead\n",
      "Françoise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not\n",
      "let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and,\n",
      "gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final \"Filthy\n",
      "creature!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have\n",
      "prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Françoise. But who would have\n",
      "baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even—roasted\n",
      "me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to\n",
      "make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt Léonie knew (though I was\n",
      "still in ignorance of this) that Françoise, who, for her own daughter or\n",
      "for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a\n",
      "singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In\n",
      "spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her\n",
      "cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise\n",
      "that Françoise's kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues\n",
      "concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to\n",
      "us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling\n",
      "with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression\n",
      "and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own\n",
      "kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which\n",
      "increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from\n",
      "herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the\n",
      "misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly\n",
      "stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of\n",
      "the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid\n",
      "was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose\n",
      "and awakened Françoise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry\n",
      "was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the\n",
      "house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a\n",
      "marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the\n",
      "symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we\n",
      "would find the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent\n",
      "Françoise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out.\n",
      "An hour elapsed, and Françoise had not returned; my mother, supposing that\n",
      "she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the\n",
      "bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Françoise who, in\n",
      "her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the\n",
      "clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that\n",
      "it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At\n",
      "each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: \"Oh, oh,\n",

      "him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of\n",
      "another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin's face shewed\n",

      "subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a\n",
      "position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been\n",

      "while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid\n",
      "and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on\n",

      "hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his\n",
      "shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most\n",
      "absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself\n",
      "to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless\n",
      "and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out\n",
      "through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred\n",

      "to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a\n",
      "point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to\n",
      "acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of\n",
      "innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though\n",
      "conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into\n",
      "surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by\n",
      "the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like\n",
      "the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we\n",
      "reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the\n",

      "the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to\n",
      "speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of\n",
      "his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but,\n",
      "striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat\n",
      "restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue\n",

      "cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the\n",
      "border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship\n",
      "into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret\n",
      "understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally\n",
      "exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of\n",
      "affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us\n",

      "father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which\n",
      "Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty\n",
      "as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals\n",
      "a man's deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has\n",
      "previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit's\n",
      "evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our\n",
      "own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and\n",
      "incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not\n",
      "been the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes,\n",

      "miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the\n",
      "distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used\n",

      "perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface,\n",
      "while it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the\n",

      "climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already\n",

      "upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon\n",
      "the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the\n",
      "scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed\n",
      "in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the\n",

      "glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves' in\n",
      "the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed\n",
      "the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the\n",
      "windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like\n",
      "strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with\n",
      "these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be\n",

      "in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the\n",
      "light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain\n",
      "intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same\n",
      "charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it\n",
      "any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred\n",
      "times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned\n",
      "away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with\n",
      "renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge,\n",
      "rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its\n",
      "fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated\n",
      "the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a\n",
      "tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme\n",
      "which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced\n",
      "apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a\n",

      "fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender\n",
      "rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy\n",
      "of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a\n",

      "And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands\n",
      "before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be\n",
      "better able to 'take in' when one has looked away, for a moment, at\n",
      "something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to\n",
      "have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they\n",
      "aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free\n",
      "itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves\n",
      "offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers\n",
      "to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that\n",
      "rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite\n",
      "different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when\n",
      "some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we\n",
      "have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of\n",
      "music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our\n",
      "ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather\n",
      "called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: \"You\n",

      "because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular\n",
      "holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for\n",
      "such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially\n",

      "which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no\n",
      "part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of\n",
      "a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them 'in colour,' and consequently\n",

      "sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese\n",
      "when it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed\n",
      "strawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some\n",
      "edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one's costume\n",
      "for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the\n",
      "reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to\n",
      "the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and\n",
      "more natural than any other tints, even after the child's mind has\n",
      "realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not\n",
      "been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had\n",
      "felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was\n",
      "in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the\n",
      "festal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature\n",

      "some procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too\n",
      "ravishing in colour, this rustic 'pompadour.' High up on the branches,\n",
      "like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of\n",

      "which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and\n",
      "blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as\n",
      "different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of\n",
      "dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and\n",
      "ready for the 'Month of Mary,' of which it seemed already to form a part,\n",

      "and altogether delightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with\n",
      "jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their\n",

      "infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to\n",
      "move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to\n",
      "take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession\n",
      "of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who\n",
      "appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was\n",
      "looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles.\n",

      "afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes\n",
      "would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion\n",

      "black—which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her—I\n",
      "should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined\n",
      "blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger\n",
      "from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out,\n",
      "petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture,\n",

      "indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face\n",
      "the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they,\n",
      "continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me,\n",
      "she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my\n",
      "direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have\n",
      "seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to\n",
      "interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good\n",
      "breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same\n",
      "time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was\n",

      "whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be\n",
      "starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded, and,\n",
      "seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in my\n",
      "direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a\n",

      "its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a\n",
      "moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to\n",
      "me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool\n",
      "as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and\n",
      "irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set\n",
      "apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her\n",

      "For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: \"Poor\n",

      "again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring\n",
      "to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her;\n",
      "I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to\n",
      "do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to\n",

      "then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of\n",
      "happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws\n",
      "of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little\n",

      "like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn\n",
      "through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to\n",
      "conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any\n",

      "fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the\n",
      "melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysées, where she lived in Paris.\n",

      "either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope\n",
      "that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors.\n",
      "For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover,\n",
      "Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a\n",
      "time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as,\n",
      "when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still\n",
      "the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send\n",
      "down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she\n",
      "would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my\n",
      "grandfather, \"Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a\n",
      "drive as far as the gate of the park.\" And in saying this she was quite\n",
      "sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the\n",
      "mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which\n",
      "its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine\n",
      "weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her\n",
      "clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired'\n",
      "again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had\n",
      "begun in her—and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of\n",
      "us—was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in\n",
      "preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed\n",
      "wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived\n",
      "for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends\n",
      "bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year,\n",
      "cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see\n",
      "one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate\n",
      "no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that\n",
      "she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house\n",
      "any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with\n",
      "all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to\n",
      "have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced\n",
      "upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she\n",
      "was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement\n",
      "'tiring' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and\n",
      "silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.\n",

      "go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying\n",
      "to make them speak of Mlle. Swann's parents and grandparents, who appeared\n",
      "to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me\n",
      "become almost mythological, of Swann—when I talked with my family I would\n",
      "grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it\n",
      "myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led\n",
      "naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in\n",
      "speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her\n",
      "company; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for\n",

      "that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more\n",
      "portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of\n",
      "all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused\n",
      "me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents,\n",
      "for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved\n",

      "Golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to the little speech read\n",
      "aloud by my great-aunt, which he seemed perfectly to understand, for he\n",
      "modified his attitude with a docility not devoid of a degree of majesty,\n",
      "so as to conform to the indications given in the text; then he rode away\n",
      "at the same jerky trot. And nothing could arrest his slow progress. If the\n",
      "lantern were moved I could still distinguish Golo's horse advancing across\n",
      "the window-curtains, swelling out with their curves and diving into their\n",
      "folds. The body of Golo himself, being of the same supernatural substance\n",
      "as his steed's, overcame all material obstacles—everything that seemed to\n",
      "bar his way—by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in\n",

      "once, would float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face, never losing\n",

      "And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which\n",
      "seemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed around\n",
      "me the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express the\n",
      "discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room\n",
      "which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought\n",
      "no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect of custom being\n",
      "destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things. The\n",

      "grandmother, who held that \"It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the\n",
      "country,\" and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the\n",
      "very wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book\n",
      "instead of letting me stay out of doors. \"That is not the way to make him\n",
      "strong and active,\" she would say sadly, \"especially this little man, who\n",

      "shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an interest in\n",
      "meteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him,\n",

      "rain. She would say, \"At last one can breathe!\" and would run up and down\n",

      "smiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards\n",
      "others, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own\n",
      "troubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those seen\n",
      "on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save for\n",
      "herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes, which\n",
      "could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them\n",
      "passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my great-aunt, the\n",
      "sight of my grandmother's vain entreaties, of her in her weakness\n",
      "conquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean\n",
      "my grandfather from his liqueur-glass—all these were things of the sort\n",
      "to which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at\n",
      "them, to take the tormentor's side with a. happy determination which\n",
      "deludes one into the belief that it is not, really, tormenting; but in\n",
      "those days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my\n",
      "great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her \"Bathilde! Come in and stop\n",
      "your husband from drinking brandy!\" in my cowardice I became at once a\n",
      "man, and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and\n",
      "injustice; I preferred not to see them; I ran up to the top of the house\n",
      "to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the\n",
      "roof, which smelt of orris-root, and was scented also by a wild\n",
      "currant-bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and\n",
      "thrust a flowering branch in through the half-opened window. Intended for\n",
      "a more special and a baser use, this room, from which, in the daytime, I\n",
      "could see as far as the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time\n",
      "my place of refuge, doubtless because it was the only room whose door Ï\n",
      "was allowed to lock, whenever my occupation was such as required an\n",
      "inviolable solitude; reading or dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of\n",
      "desire. Alas! I little knew that my own lack of will-power, my delicate\n",

      "heavily on my grandmother's mind than any little breach of the rules by\n",

      "in which we used to see passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the\n",
      "heavens, her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with\n",
      "age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn,\n",
      "covered, if she were walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon\n",

      "for so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in which\n",
      "I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her garden\n",
      "dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited straw,\n",
      "rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment of the\n",
      "keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached the\n",
      "stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as to prolong\n",
      "the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared.\n",
      "Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I longed to\n",
      "call her back, to say to her \"Kiss me just once again,\" but I knew that\n",
      "then she would at once look displeased, for the concession which she made\n",
      "to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of\n",
      "peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies absurd, and\n",
      "she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need, the custom\n",
      "of having her there at all, which was a very different thing from letting\n",
      "the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was\n",
      "already crossing the threshold. And to see her look displeased destroyed\n",
      "all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before, when she\n",
      "bent her loving face down over my bed, and held it out to me like a Host,\n",
      "for an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of\n",
      "her real presence, and with it the power to sleep. But those evenings on\n",
      "which Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared\n",
      "to those on which we had guests to dinner, and therefore she did not come\n",
      "at all. Our 'guests' were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from\n",
      "a few passing strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the\n",
      "house at Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently\n",
      "since his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his\n",
      "wife) and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we\n",
      "sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron\n",
      "table, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and noisy\n",
      "rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous,\n",
      "interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out\n",
      "of action by coming in 'without ringing,' but the double peal—timid,\n",
      "oval, gilded—of the visitors' bell, everyone would at once exclaim \"A\n",
      "visitor! Who in the world can it be?\" but they knew quite well that it\n",
      "could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud voice, to set an\n",
      "example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell\n",
      "the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a\n",
      "stranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying\n",
      "things about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother\n",
      "would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an\n",
      "additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove\n",
      "surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to\n",
      "make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother might run her hand\n",
      "through her boy's hair, after the barber had smoothed it down, to make it\n",
      "stick out properly round his head.\n",

      "invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: \"I can hear\n",
      "Swann's voice.\" And, indeed, one could tell him only by his voice, for it\n",
      "was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes,\n",
      "under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red hair, dressed in the\n",
      "Bressant style, because in the garden we used as little light as possible,\n",
      "so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would slip away as though not going\n",
      "for anything in particular, to tell them to bring out the syrups; for my\n",
      "grandmother made a great point, thinking it 'nicer,' of their not being\n",
      "allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary, which we kept for visitors\n",
      "only. Although a far younger man, M. Swann was very much attached to my\n",
      "grandfather, who had been an intimate friend, in his time, of Swann's\n",
      "father, an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing\n",
      "would, it seemed, often check the flow of his spirits and divert the\n",
      "current of his thoughts. Several times in the course of a year I would\n",
      "hear my grandfather tell at table the story, which never varied, of the\n",
      "behaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife, by whose\n",
      "bedside he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him\n",
      "for a long time, hastened to join him at the Swanns' family property on\n",
      "the outskirts of Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping\n",
      "profusely, out of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when\n",
      "the body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park,\n",
      "where there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather\n",
      "by the arm and cried, \"Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be\n",
      "walking here together on such a charming day! Don't you see how pretty\n",
      "they are, all these trees—my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you\n",
      "have never congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don't you\n",
      "feel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive\n",
      "all the same, my dear Amédée!\" And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead\n",
      "wife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire\n",
      "into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away\n",
      "by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he\n",
      "habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind:\n",
      "that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped\n",
      "his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but\n",
      "used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived\n",
      "her, \"It's a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I\n",
      "cannot think of her very much at any one time.\" \"Often, but a little at a\n",
      "time, like poor old Swann,\" became one of my grandfather's favourite\n",
      "phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have\n",
      "assumed that this father of Swann's had been a monster if my grandfather,\n",
      "whom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law\n",
      "and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have\n",
      "been inclined to condemn, had not gone on to exclaim, \"But, after all, he\n",
      "had a heart of gold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, albeit—and especially before his marriage—M. Swann the\n",
      "younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and grandparents\n",
      "never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society\n",
      "which his family had frequented, or that, under the sort of incognito\n",
      "which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring—with the\n",

      "Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the\n",

      "discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days\n",
      "took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist\n",
      "of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself\n",
      "called to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and\n",
      "nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good' marriage,\n",
      "could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste. M.\n",

      "himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune, as in a list of\n",
      "taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income. We knew the\n",

      "associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.' If he knew\n",
      "other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old\n",

      "good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came\n",
      "most faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the\n",
      "people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom\n",

      "all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position, his\n",
      "coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a\n",
      "very simple life, and having always had a craze for 'antiques' and\n",
      "pictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which\n",
      "my grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d'Orléans, a\n",
      "neighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be\n",
      "quartered. \"Are you really a connoisseur, now?\" she would say to him; \"I\n",
      "ask for your own sake, as you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you\n",
      "by the dealers,\" for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical\n",

      "conversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull\n",
      "preciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most\n",
      "minute details, but even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him\n",
      "about art. When challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his\n",
      "admiration for some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and\n",
      "would then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other\n",
      "about the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it\n",
      "had been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to\n",
      "amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure—and he would\n",
      "have a fresh story for us on every occasion—with some one whom we\n",
      "ourselves knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman.\n",

      "It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted a\n",

      "the House of France, \"Gentlemen, you and I will never know, will we, and\n",
      "don't want to, do we?\" my great-aunt would say tartly to Swann, who had,\n",

      "times and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will\n",

      "the sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details\n",
      "of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole,\n",
      "which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in\n",
      "an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created\n",
      "by the thoughts of other people. Even the simple act which we describe as\n",
      "\"seeing some one we know\" is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We\n",
      "pack the physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we\n",
      "have already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we\n",

      "people, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and\n",
      "stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but they\n",
      "contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been\n",
      "evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the\n",
      "depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not\n",
      "unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together\n",
      "after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during\n",
      "our companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so well\n",
      "lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family,\n",
      "that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living\n",
      "creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know\n",
      "for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from\n",
      "the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann—this\n",
      "early Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of my\n",
      "childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like his successor than he is\n",

      "of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady\n",
      "whom she had known at the Sacré Cœur (and with whom, because of our caste\n",
      "theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of\n",
      "several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous\n",
      "house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephews,\n",
      "the des Laumes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house,\n",
      "which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had\n",
      "advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his\n",
      "daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone\n",
      "to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the\n",
      "staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the\n",
      "girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the\n",
      "finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly\n",
      "independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the\n",
      "tailor had made, saying to Mamma:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sévigné would not have said it better!\" and, by way of contrast, of a\n",
      "nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, he is so common!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in\n",
      "my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared\n",
      "that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we owed to Mme.\n",
      "de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing\n",
      "that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed\n",
      "in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and in allowing members\n",
      "of her family to associate with him. \"How should she know Swann? A lady\n",
      "who, you always made out, was related to Marshal MacMahon!\" This view of\n",
      "Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be\n",
      "confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you\n",
      "might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him justice, he never\n",
      "attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though\n",
      "he came more and more seldom; but from whom they thought they could\n",
      "establish, on the assumption that he had found her there, the circle,\n",
      "unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was\n",
      "one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the\n",
      "Duc de X——, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent\n",
      "statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious\n",
      "to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental\n",
      "share in the private lives of men like Molé, the Duc Pasquier, or the Duc\n",
      "de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who\n",
      "had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in\n",
      "a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates\n",
      "outside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his 'proper\n",
      "station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her\n",
      "that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly\n",
      "relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and\n",
      "store up for their children's benefit, for my great-aunt had actually\n",
      "ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a\n",
      "'Highness' and had thereby stepped down—in her eyes—from the respectable\n",
      "position of a lawyer's son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen\n",
      "or stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn\n",
      "their favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of\n",
      "questioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people\n",
      "whose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my\n",
      "grandmother's two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of\n",
      "character but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not\n",
      "conceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about\n",
      "such trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were\n",
      "incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the\n",
      "'pinchbeck' things of life, even when they had an historic value, or,\n",
      "generally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some\n",
      "object aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest\n",
      "in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday\n",
      "life that their sense of hearing—which had gradually come to understand\n",
      "its own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table,\n",
      "became frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able\n",
      "to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves—would leave its\n",
      "receptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually\n",
      "becoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the\n",
      "attention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm\n",
      "signals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as\n",
      "by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them\n",
      "at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent\n",
      "methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their\n",
      "everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or\n",
      "because they think the whole world a trifle mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with\n",
      "us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my\n",
      "great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the _Figaro_ in which to the\n",
      "name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words,\n",
      "\"from the collection of M. Charles Swann,\" asked: \"Did you see that Swann\n",
      "is 'mentioned' in the _Figaro_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I have always told you,\" said my grandmother, \"that he had plenty of\n",
      "taste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would, of course,\" retorted my great-aunt, \"say anything just to seem\n",
      "different from _us_.\" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with\n",
      "her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the\n",
      "rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale\n",
      "condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she hoped to force\n",
      "us into solidarity with her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to\n",
      "mention to Swann this reference to him in the _Figaro_, my great-aunt\n",
      "dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial,\n",
      "which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no\n",
      "advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should\n",
      "hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and\n",
      "I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's\n",
      "sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a\n",
      "fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious\n",
      "circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to\n",
      "whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing\n",
      "to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of\n",
      "his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood\n",
      "that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very\n",
      "hard for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My father, however, was annoyed: \"No, no; you have the most absurd ideas.\n",
      "It would be utterly ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave rise\n",
      "to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings\n",
      "when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma did not\n",
      "come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with the family:\n",
      "I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and\n",
      "went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others,\n",
      "and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o'clock, when it\n",
      "was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and precious kiss which\n",
      "Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I was in bed and just going\n",
      "to sleep I had to take with me from the dining-room to my own, and to keep\n",
      "inviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its\n",
      "sweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself\n",
      "and evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most\n",
      "pains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it\n",
      "instantly and in public, without even having the time or being properly\n",
      "free to apply to what I was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who\n",
      "compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while\n",
      "they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps\n",
      "over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the\n",
      "recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded\n",
      "shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one\n",
      "another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,\" my grandfather warned\n",
      "his two sisters-in-law; \"you know how good it is, and it is a huge case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, don't start whispering!\" said my great-aunt. \"How would you like to\n",
      "come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! There's M. Swann,\" cried my father. \"Let's ask him if he thinks it\n",
      "will be fine to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the\n",
      "unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his\n",
      "marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I\n",
      "followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me\n",
      "while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the\n",
      "dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on\n",
      "ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, M. Swann,\" she said, \"do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she\n",
      "shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,\" said my\n",
      "grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but\n",
      "managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of\n",
      "thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the\n",
      "discovery of their finest lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,\" she said, or\n",
      "rather whispered to Swann. \"It is only a mother who can understand. I am\n",
      "sure that hers would agree with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to\n",
      "think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening,\n",
      "alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to\n",
      "convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should\n",
      "have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the\n",
      "future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss\n",
      "that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding,\n",
      "distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any\n",
      "other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the\n",
      "condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of\n",
      "quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a\n",
      "surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a\n",
      "clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet\n",
      "feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my\n",
      "grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc\n",
      "d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or\n",
      "amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question\n",
      "Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose\n",
      "ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her\n",
      "natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me\n",
      "some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in\n",
      "Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure!\" said her sister Flora, \"but I haven't wasted my time either.\n",
      "I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows Maubant quite\n",
      "well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his\n",
      "parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of\n",
      "M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,\" cried my aunt\n",
      "Céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed\n",
      "forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long;\n",
      "darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann.\n",
      "And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Céline's\n",
      "way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a\n",
      "blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to\n",
      "underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann his\n",
      "having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was\n",
      "embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it would be worth while,\" Flora went on, \"to have this old\n",
      "gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will\n",
      "talk for hours on end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That must be delightful,\" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had\n",
      "unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming\n",
      "passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of\n",
      "Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as\n",
      "it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of\n",
      "that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to\n",
      "extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Molé or of the\n",
      "Comte de Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say!\" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, \"what I was going to tell you\n",
      "has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now,\n",
      "for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a\n",
      "passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in\n",
      "the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little\n",
      "more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well\n",
      "written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism\n",
      "that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the\n",
      "papers very pleasant indeed!\" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that\n",
      "she had read the note about his Corot in the _Figaro_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" aunt Céline went one better. \"When they write about things or\n",
      "people in whom we are interested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't deny it,\" answered Swann in some bewilderment. \"The fault I\n",
      "find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some\n",
      "fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a\n",
      "lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every\n",
      "morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a\n",
      "transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it—oh! I\n",
      "don't know; shall we say Pascal's _Pensées_?\" He articulated the title with\n",
      "an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. \"And then, in the gilt and\n",
      "tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,\" he went on, shewing that\n",
      "contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to\n",
      "affect, \"we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at\n",
      "Cannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had given a fancy dress ball. In\n",
      "that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information'\n",
      "and 'publicity.'\" But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to\n",
      "speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: \"We are\n",
      "having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to\n",
      "these lofty summits,\" and then, turning to my grandfather: \"Well,\n",

      "\"What! Do you call that thanking him?\" shouted my grandfather. \"I heard\n",
      "that all right, but devil take me if I guessed it was meant for Swann.\n",
      "You may be quite sure he never noticed it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come; Swann is not a fool. I am positive he appreciated the\n",

      "guess what he paid for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment; then my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"As you wish, dear, though I don't feel in the least like sleeping. I\n",
      "don't know why; it can't be the coffee-ice—it wasn't strong enough to\n",
      "keep me awake like this. But I see a light in the servants' hall: poor\n",
      "Françoise has been sitting up for me, so I will get her to unhook me while\n",
      "you go and undress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the\n",
      "staircase. Presently I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I\n",
      "went quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I\n",
      "could hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety,\n",
      "but with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light\n",
      "coming upwards, from Mamma's candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw\n",
      "myself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not\n",
      "realising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression of\n",
      "anger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used to\n",
      "go for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences than\n",
      "this. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that further\n",
      "intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility, and that might\n",
      "perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as indicating that, with\n",
      "such a punishment as was in store for me, mere silence, and even anger,\n",
      "were relatively puerile.\n",
      "\n",
      "A word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one\n",
      "converses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice; the\n",
      "kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which would\n",
      "have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being angry with\n",
      "him for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the dressing-room,\n",
      "where he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid the 'scene' which\n",
      "he would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice half-stifled by her\n",
      "anger: \"Run away at once. Don't let your father see you standing there\n",
      "like a crazy jane!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But I begged her again to \"Come and say good night to me!\" terrified as I\n",
      "saw the light from my father's candle already creeping up the wall, but\n",
      "also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope that\n",
      "my mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must if she\n",
      "continued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: \"Go back to your\n",
      "room. I will come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Too late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one\n",
      "heard me, \"I am done for!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do\n",
      "things which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters\n",
      "granted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to\n",
      "'Principles,' and because in his sight there were no such things as\n",
      "'Rights of Man.' For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at\n",
      "all, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular\n",
      "walk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of it\n",
      "was a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening, long\n",
      "before the appointed hour he would snap out: \"Run along up to bed now; no\n",
      "excuses!\" But then again, simply because he was devoid of principles (in\n",
      "my grandmother's sense), so he could not, properly speaking, be called\n",
      "inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and\n",
      "surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without some\n",
      "embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: \"Go along with him, then;\n",
      "you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep, so stay in his room for\n",
      "a little. I don't need anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But dear,\" my mother answered timidly, \"whether or not I feel like sleep\n",
      "is not the point; we must not make the child accustomed...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no question of making him accustomed,\" said my father, with a\n",
      "shrug of the shoulders; \"you can see quite well that the child is unhappy.\n",
      "After all, we aren't gaolers. You'll end by making him ill, and a lot of\n",
      "good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell Françoise to make\n",
      "up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the rest of the night. I'm\n",
      "off to bed, anyhow; I'm not nervous like you. Good night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my\n",
      "sentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring to\n",
      "move; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white\n",
      "nightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere in\n",
      "which, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up his\n",
      "head, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli which\n",
      "M. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself away from\n",
      "Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase,\n",
      "up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb, was long\n",
      "ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have perished which, I\n",
      "imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have arisen, giving\n",
      "birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have\n",
      "foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of comprehension. It is a long\n",
      "time, too, since my father has been able to tell Mamma to \"Go with the\n",
      "child.\" Never again will such hours be possible for me. But of late I have\n",
      "been increasingly able to catch, if I listen attentively, the sound of the\n",
      "sobs which I had the strength to control in my father's presence, and\n",
      "which broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their\n",
      "echo has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and\n",
      "more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent\n",
      "bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the\n",
      "streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until\n",
      "they sound out again through the silent evening air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so\n",
      "deadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents\n",
      "gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward\n",
      "of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this\n",
      "crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat\n",
      "arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and\n",
      "due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance\n",
      "expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I\n",
      "called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title\n",
      "less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his nature,\n",
      "which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably\n",
      "prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening,\n",
      "a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but they loved me\n",
      "enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering, which they hoped to\n",
      "teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to\n",
      "strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of\n",
      "another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon\n",
      "as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother:\n",
      "\"Go and comfort him.\" Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed\n",
      "that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different\n",
      "from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Françoise (who\n",
      "guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma\n",
      "sitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to\n",
      "her: \"But, Madame, what is little Master crying for?\" she replied: \"Why,\n",
      "Françoise, he doesn't know himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed\n",
      "for me quickly and then go off to your own.\" And thus for the first time\n",
      "my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be\n",
      "punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised\n",
      "a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the\n",
      "consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the\n",
      "bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no\n",
      "small degree of pride, either, in Franchise's presence at this return to\n",
      "humane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to\n",
      "my room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep,\n",
      "raised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a\n",
      "sort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to\n",
      "have been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a\n",
      "first concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first\n",
      "step down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first\n",
      "time she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck\n",
      "me that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had\n",
      "succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing\n",
      "her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era,\n",
      "must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared now, I\n",
      "should have said to Mamma: \"No, I don't want you; you mustn't sleep here.\"\n",
      "But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what would be called\n",
      "nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my\n",
      "grandmother's nature, and I knew that now the mischief was done she would\n",
      "prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to\n",
      "disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed\n",
      "to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands\n",
      "and trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me\n",
      "that this should not have happened; her anger would have been less\n",
      "difficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not\n",
      "known; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first\n",
      "wrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head.\n",
      "This thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw that Mamma, who had never\n",
      "allowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me, was suddenly\n",
      "overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as\n",
      "she saw that I had noticed this, she said to me, with a smile: \"Why, my\n",
      "little buttercup, my little canary-boy, he's going to make Mamma as silly\n",
      "as himself if this goes on. Look, since you can't sleep, and Mamma can't\n",
      "either, we mustn't go on in this stupid way; we must do something; I'll\n",
      "get one of your books.\" But I had none there. \"Would you like me to get\n",
      "out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your\n",
      "birthday? Just think it over first, and don't be disappointed if there is\n",
      "nothing new for you then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books in\n",
      "which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was wrapped,\n",
      "any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this first\n",
      "glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the\n",
      "paint-box of last New Year's Day and the silkworms of the year before. It\n",
      "contained _La Mare au Diable_, _François le Champi_, _La Petite Fadette_,\n",
      "and _Les Maîtres Sonneurs_. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had\n",
      "at first chosen Mussel's poems, a volume of Rousseau, and _Indiana_; for\n",
      "while she considered light reading as unwholesome as sweets and cakes, she\n",
      "did not reflect that the strong breath of genius must have upon the very\n",
      "soul of a child an influence at once more dangerous and less quickening\n",
      "than those of fresh air and country breezes upon his body. But when my\n",
      "father had seemed almost to regard her as insane on learning the names of\n",
      "the books she proposed to give me, she had journeyed back by herself to\n",
      "Jouy-le-Vicomte to the bookseller's, so that there should be no fear of my\n",
      "not having my present in time (it was a burning hot day, and she had come\n",
      "home so unwell that the doctor had warned my mother not to allow her again\n",
      "to tire herself in that way), and had there fallen back upon the four\n",
      "pastoral novels of George Sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" she had said to Mamma, \"I could not allow myself to give the\n",
      "child anything that was not well written.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was that she could never make up her mind to purchase anything\n",
      "from which no intellectual profit was to be derived, and, above all, that\n",
      "profit which good things bestowed on us by teaching us to seek our\n",
      "pleasures elsewhere than in the barren satisfaction of worldly wealth.\n",
      "Even when she had to make some one a present of the kind called 'useful,'\n",
      "when she had to give an armchair or some table-silver or a walking-stick,\n",
      "she would choose 'antiques,' as though their long desuetude had effaced\n",
      "from them any semblance of utility and fitted them rather to instruct us\n",
      "in the lives of the men of other days than to serve the common\n",
      "requirements of our own. She would have liked me to have in my room\n",
      "photographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places. But at the moment\n",
      "of buying them, and for all that the subject of the picture had an\n",
      "aesthetic value of its own, she would find that vulgarity and utility had\n",
      "too prominent a part in them, through the mechanical nature of their\n",
      "reproduction by photography. She attempted by a subterfuge, if not to\n",
      "eliminate altogether their commercial banality, at least to minimise it,\n",
      "to substitute for the bulk of it what was art still, to introduce, as it\n",
      "might be, several 'thicknesses' of art; instead of photographs of Chartres\n",
      "Cathedral, of the Fountains of Saint-Cloud, or of Vesuvius she would\n",
      "inquire of Swann whether some great painter had not made pictures of them,\n",
      "and preferred to give me photographs of 'Chartres Cathedral' after Corot,\n",
      "of the 'Fountains of Saint-Cloud' after Hubert Robert, and of 'Vesuvius'\n",
      "after Turner, which were a stage higher in the scale of art. But although\n",
      "the photographer had been prevented from reproducing directly the\n",
      "masterpieces or the beauties of nature, and had there been replaced by a\n",
      "great artist, he resumed his odious position when it came to reproducing\n",
      "the artist's interpretation. Accordingly, having to reckon again with\n",
      "vulgarity, my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of\n",
      "contact still further. She would ask Swann if the picture had not been\n",
      "engraved, preferring, when possible, old engravings with some interest of\n",
      "association apart from themselves, such, for example, as shew us a\n",
      "masterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it to-day, as\n",
      "Morghen's print of the 'Cenacolo' of Leonardo before it was spoiled by\n",
      "restoration. It must be admitted that the results of this method of\n",
      "interpreting the art of making presents were not always happy. The idea\n",
      "which I formed of Venice, from a drawing by Titian which is supposed to\n",
      "have the lagoon in the background, was certainly far less accurate than\n",
      "what I have since derived from ordinary photographs. We could no longer\n",
      "keep count in the family (when my great-aunt tried to frame an indictment\n",
      "of my grandmother) of all the armchairs she had presented to married\n",
      "couples, young and old, which on a first attempt to sit down upon them had\n",
      "at once collapsed beneath the weight of their recipient. But my\n",
      "grandmother would have thought it sordid to concern herself too closely\n",
      "with the solidity of any piece of furniture in which could still be\n",
      "discerned a flourish, a smile, a brave conceit of the past. And even what\n",
      "in such pieces supplied a material need, since it did so in a manner to\n",
      "which we are no longer accustomed, was as charming to her as one of those\n",
      "old forms of speech in which we can still see traces of a metaphor whose\n",
      "fine point has been worn away by the rough usage of our modern tongue. In\n",
      "precisely the same way the pastoral novels of George Sand, which she was\n",
      "giving me for my birthday, were regular lumber-rooms of antique furniture,\n",
      "full of expressions that have fallen out of use and returned as imagery,\n",
      "such as one finds now only in country dialects. And my grandmother had\n",
      "bought them in preference to other books, just as she would have preferred\n",
      "to take a house that had a gothic dovecot, or some other such piece of\n",
      "antiquity as would have a pleasant effect on the mind, filling it with a\n",
      "nostalgic longing for impossible journeys through the realms of time.\n",

      "Mamma sat down by my bed; she had chosen _François le Champi_, whose\n",

      "my eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real novels.\n",
      "I had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist. That prepared\n",
      "me in advance to imagine that _François le Champi_ contained something\n",
      "inexpressibly delicious. The course of the narrative, where it tended to\n",
      "arouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain modes of expression which\n",
      "disturb or sadden the reader, and which, with a little experience, he may\n",
      "recognise as 'common form' in novels, seemed to me then distinctive—for\n",
      "to me a new book was not one of a number of similar objects, but was like\n",
      "an individual man, unmatched, and with no cause of existence beyond\n",
      "himself—an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar essence of _François le\n",
      "Champi_. Beneath the everyday incidents, the commonplace thoughts and\n",
      "hackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an intonation, a rhythmic\n",
      "utterance fine and strange. The 'action' began: to me it seemed all the\n",
      "more obscure because in those days, when I read to myself, I used often,\n",
      "while I turned the pages, to dream of something quite different. And to\n",
      "the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more were\n",
      "added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was reading to me aloud she\n",
      "left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd changes which take place\n",
      "in the relations between the miller's wife and the boy, changes which only\n",
      "the birth and growth of love can explain, seemed to me plunged and steeped\n",
      "in a mystery, the key to which (as I could readily believe) lay in that\n",
      "strange and pleasant-sounding name of _Champi_, which draped the boy who\n",
      "bore it, I knew not why, in its own bright colour, purpurate and charming.\n",
      "If my mother was not a faithful reader, she was, none the less, admirable\n",
      "when reading a work in which she found the note of true feeling by the\n",
      "respectful simplicity of her interpretation and by the sound of her sweet\n",
      "and gentle voice. It was the same in her daily life, when it was not works\n",
      "of art but men and women whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was\n",
      "touching to observe with what deference she would banish from her voice,\n",
      "her gestures, from her whole conversation, now the note of joy which might\n",
      "have distressed some mother who had long ago lost a child, now the\n",
      "recollection of an event or anniversary which might have reminded some old\n",
      "gentleman of the burden of his years, now the household topic which might\n",
      "have bored some young man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the\n",

      "not to teach her until much later to refrain from placing, in the same\n",
      "way, above all other qualities in literature; taking pains to banish from\n",
      "her voice any weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel\n",
      "for that powerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural\n",
      "tenderness, all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which\n",

      "speak, within her compass. She came to them with the tone that they\n",
      "required, with the cordial accent which existed before they were, which\n",
      "dictated them, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and\n",
      "by these means she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there\n",
      "might be or discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and\n",

      "And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which\n",
      "seemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed around\n",
      "me the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express the\n",
      "discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room\n",
      "which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought\n",
      "no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect of custom being\n",
      "destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things. The\n",
      "door-handle of my room, which was different to me from all the other\n",
      "doorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to open of its own accord\n",

      "of Geneviève de Brabant had made all the dearer to me, just as the crimes\n",
      "of Golo had driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of\n",
      "my own conscience.\n",

      "But after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed\n",
      "talking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little\n",
      "parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my\n",
      "grandmother, who held that \"It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the\n",
      "country,\" and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the\n",

      "looked at him with tender respect, but not too hard, not wishing to\n",
      "penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my grandmother, in all\n",
      "weathers, even when the rain was coming down in torrents and Françoise had\n",
      "rushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs, so that they should not\n",

      "lashed by the storm, pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her\n",
      "brows might be more free to imbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and\n",
      "rain. She would say, \"At last one can breathe!\" and would run up and down\n",
      "the soaking paths—too straight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to\n",
      "the want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had\n",
      "been asking all morning if the weather were going to improve—with her\n",
      "keen, jerky little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her\n",

      "the spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which\n",

      "taste the brandy; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops\n",
      "all the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still\n",
      "smiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards\n",
      "others, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own\n",
      "troubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those seen\n",
      "on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save for\n",
      "herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes, which\n",
      "could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them\n",
      "passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my great-aunt, the\n",
      "sight of my grandmother's vain entreaties, of her in her weakness\n",
      "conquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean\n",
      "my grandfather from his liqueur-glass—all these were things of the sort\n",
      "to which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at\n",
      "them, to take the tormentor's side with a. happy determination which\n",
      "deludes one into the belief that it is not, really, tormenting; but in\n",
      "those days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my\n",
      "great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her \"Bathilde! Come in and stop\n",
      "your husband from drinking brandy!\" in my cowardice I became at once a\n",
      "man, and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and\n",
      "injustice; I preferred not to see them; I ran up to the top of the house\n",
      "to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the\n",
      "roof, which smelt of orris-root, and was scented also by a wild\n",
      "currant-bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and\n",
      "thrust a flowering branch in through the half-opened window. Intended for\n",
      "a more special and a baser use, this room, from which, in the daytime, I\n",
      "could see as far as the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time\n",
      "my place of refuge, doubtless because it was the only room whose door Ï\n",
      "was allowed to lock, whenever my occupation was such as required an\n",
      "inviolable solitude; reading or dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of\n",
      "desire. Alas! I little knew that my own lack of will-power, my delicate\n",
      "health, and the consequent uncertainty as to my future weighed far more\n",
      "heavily on my grandmother's mind than any little breach of the rules by\n",
      "her husband, during those endless perambulations, afternoon and evening,\n",
      "in which we used to see passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the\n",
      "heavens, her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with\n",
      "age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn,\n",
      "covered, if she were walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon\n",

      "traces of an involuntary tear.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma\n",
      "would come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted\n",
      "for so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in which\n",
      "I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her garden\n",
      "dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited straw,\n",
      "rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment of the\n",
      "keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached the\n",
      "stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as to prolong\n",
      "the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared.\n",
      "Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I longed to\n",
      "call her back, to say to her \"Kiss me just once again,\" but I knew that\n",
      "then she would at once look displeased, for the concession which she made\n",
      "to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of\n",
      "peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies absurd, and\n",
      "she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need, the custom\n",
      "of having her there at all, which was a very different thing from letting\n",
      "the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was\n",
      "already crossing the threshold. And to see her look displeased destroyed\n",
      "all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before, when she\n",
      "bent her loving face down over my bed, and held it out to me like a Host,\n",
      "for an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of\n",
      "her real presence, and with it the power to sleep. But those evenings on\n",
      "which Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared\n",
      "to those on which we had guests to dinner, and therefore she did not come\n",
      "at all. Our 'guests' were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from\n",
      "a few passing strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the\n",
      "house at Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently\n",
      "since his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his\n",
      "wife) and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we\n",
      "sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron\n",
      "table, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and noisy\n",
      "rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous,\n",
      "interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out\n",
      "of action by coming in 'without ringing,' but the double peal—timid,\n",
      "oval, gilded—of the visitors' bell, everyone would at once exclaim \"A\n",
      "visitor! Who in the world can it be?\" but they knew quite well that it\n",
      "could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud voice, to set an\n",
      "example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell\n",
      "the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a\n",
      "stranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying\n",
      "things about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother\n",
      "would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an\n",
      "additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove\n",
      "surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to\n",
      "make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother might run her hand\n",
      "through her boy's hair, after the barber had smoothed it down, to make it\n",
      "stick out properly round his head.\n",

      "invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: \"I can hear\n",
      "Swann's voice.\" And, indeed, one could tell him only by his voice, for it\n",
      "was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes,\n",
      "under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red hair, dressed in the\n",
      "Bressant style, because in the garden we used as little light as possible,\n",
      "so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would slip away as though not going\n",
      "for anything in particular, to tell them to bring out the syrups; for my\n",
      "grandmother made a great point, thinking it 'nicer,' of their not being\n",
      "allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary, which we kept for visitors\n",
      "only. Although a far younger man, M. Swann was very much attached to my\n",
      "grandfather, who had been an intimate friend, in his time, of Swann's\n",
      "father, an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing\n",
      "would, it seemed, often check the flow of his spirits and divert the\n",
      "current of his thoughts. Several times in the course of a year I would\n",
      "hear my grandfather tell at table the story, which never varied, of the\n",
      "behaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife, by whose\n",
      "bedside he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him\n",
      "for a long time, hastened to join him at the Swanns' family property on\n",
      "the outskirts of Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping\n",
      "profusely, out of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when\n",
      "the body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park,\n",
      "where there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather\n",
      "by the arm and cried, \"Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be\n",
      "walking here together on such a charming day! Don't you see how pretty\n",
      "they are, all these trees—my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you\n",
      "have never congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don't you\n",
      "feel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive\n",
      "all the same, my dear Amédée!\" And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead\n",
      "wife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire\n",
      "into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away\n",
      "by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he\n",
      "habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind:\n",
      "that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped\n",
      "his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but\n",
      "used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived\n",
      "her, \"It's a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I\n",
      "cannot think of her very much at any one time.\" \"Often, but a little at a\n",
      "time, like poor old Swann,\" became one of my grandfather's favourite\n",
      "phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have\n",
      "assumed that this father of Swann's had been a monster if my grandfather,\n",
      "whom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law\n",
      "and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have\n",
      "been inclined to condemn, had not gone on to exclaim, \"But, after all, he\n",
      "had a heart of gold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, albeit—and especially before his marriage—M. Swann the\n",
      "younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and grandparents\n",
      "never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society\n",
      "which his family had frequented, or that, under the sort of incognito\n",
      "which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring—with the\n",
      "complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their\n",

      "\n",
      "Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the\n",
      "world of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and\n",
      "discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days\n",
      "took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist\n",
      "of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself\n",
      "called to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and\n",
      "nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good' marriage,\n",
      "could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste. M.\n",

      "himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune, as in a list of\n",
      "taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income. We knew the\n",
      "people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew his own\n",
      "associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.' If he knew\n",
      "other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old\n",
      "friends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes all the more\n",
      "good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came\n",
      "most faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the\n",
      "people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom\n",
      "he would not have dared to raise his hat, had he met them while he was\n",
      "walking with ourselves. Had there been such a thing as a determination to\n",
      "apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself, as distinct from\n",
      "all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position, his\n",
      "coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a\n",
      "very simple life, and having always had a craze for 'antiques' and\n",
      "pictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which\n",
      "my grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d'Orléans, a\n",
      "neighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be\n",
      "quartered. \"Are you really a connoisseur, now?\" she would say to him; \"I\n",
      "ask for your own sake, as you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you\n",
      "by the dealers,\" for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical\n",
      "faculty, and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in\n",
      "conversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull\n",
      "preciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most\n",
      "minute details, but even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him\n",
      "about art. When challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his\n",
      "admiration for some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and\n",
      "would then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other\n",
      "about the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it\n",
      "had been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to\n",
      "amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure—and he would\n",
      "have a fresh story for us on every occasion—with some one whom we\n",
      "ourselves knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman.\n",
      "These stories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could\n",
      "never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann\n",
      "invariably made himself play in the adventures, or of the wit that he\n",
      "shewed in telling us of them. \"It is easy to see that you are a regular\n",

      "that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living\n",
      "creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know\n",
      "for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from\n",
      "the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann—this\n",

      "abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree,\n",
      "of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady\n",
      "whom she had known at the Sacré Cœur (and with whom, because of our caste\n",
      "theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of\n",
      "several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous\n",

      "\n",
      "My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house,\n",
      "which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had\n",
      "advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his\n",
      "daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone\n",
      "to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the\n",
      "staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the\n",
      "girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the\n",
      "finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly\n",
      "independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the\n",
      "tailor had made, saying to Mamma:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sévigné would not have said it better!\" and, by way of contrast, of a\n",
      "nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, he is so common!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in\n",
      "my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared\n",
      "that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we owed to Mme.\n",
      "de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing\n",
      "that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed\n",
      "in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and in allowing members\n",
      "of her family to associate with him. \"How should she know Swann? A lady\n",
      "who, you always made out, was related to Marshal MacMahon!\" This view of\n",
      "Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be\n",
      "confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you\n",
      "might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him justice, he never\n",
      "attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though\n",

      "unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was\n",
      "one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the\n",
      "Duc de X——, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent\n",
      "statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious\n",
      "to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental\n",
      "share in the private lives of men like Molé, the Duc Pasquier, or the Duc\n",
      "de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who\n",
      "had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in\n",
      "a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates\n",
      "outside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his 'proper\n",
      "station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her\n",
      "that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly\n",
      "relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and\n",
      "store up for their children's benefit, for my great-aunt had actually\n",
      "ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a\n",
      "'Highness' and had thereby stepped down—in her eyes—from the respectable\n",
      "position of a lawyer's son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen\n",
      "or stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn\n",
      "their favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of\n",
      "questioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people\n",
      "whose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my\n",
      "grandmother's two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of\n",
      "character but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not\n",
      "conceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about\n",
      "such trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were\n",
      "incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the\n",
      "'pinchbeck' things of life, even when they had an historic value, or,\n",
      "generally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some\n",
      "object aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest\n",
      "in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday\n",
      "life that their sense of hearing—which had gradually come to understand\n",
      "its own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table,\n",
      "became frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able\n",
      "to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves—would leave its\n",
      "receptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually\n",
      "becoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the\n",
      "attention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm\n",
      "signals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as\n",
      "by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them\n",
      "at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent\n",
      "methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their\n",
      "everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or\n",
      "because they think the whole world a trifle mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with\n",
      "us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my\n",
      "great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the _Figaro_ in which to the\n",
      "name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words,\n",
      "\"from the collection of M. Charles Swann,\" asked: \"Did you see that Swann\n",
      "is 'mentioned' in the _Figaro_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I have always told you,\" said my grandmother, \"that he had plenty of\n",
      "taste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would, of course,\" retorted my great-aunt, \"say anything just to seem\n",
      "different from _us_.\" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with\n",
      "her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the\n",
      "rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale\n",
      "condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she hoped to force\n",
      "us into solidarity with her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to\n",
      "mention to Swann this reference to him in the _Figaro_, my great-aunt\n",
      "dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial,\n",
      "which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no\n",
      "advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should\n",
      "hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and\n",
      "I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's\n",
      "sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a\n",
      "fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious\n",
      "circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to\n",
      "whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing\n",
      "to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of\n",
      "his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood\n",
      "that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very\n",
      "hard for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My father, however, was annoyed: \"No, no; you have the most absurd ideas.\n",
      "It would be utterly ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave rise\n",
      "to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings\n",
      "when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma did not\n",
      "come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with the family:\n",
      "I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and\n",
      "went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others,\n",
      "and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o'clock, when it\n",
      "was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and precious kiss which\n",
      "Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I was in bed and just going\n",
      "to sleep I had to take with me from the dining-room to my own, and to keep\n",
      "inviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its\n",
      "sweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself\n",
      "and evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most\n",
      "pains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it\n",
      "instantly and in public, without even having the time or being properly\n",
      "free to apply to what I was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who\n",
      "compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while\n",
      "they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps\n",
      "over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the\n",
      "recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded\n",
      "shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one\n",
      "another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,\" my grandfather warned\n",
      "his two sisters-in-law; \"you know how good it is, and it is a huge case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, don't start whispering!\" said my great-aunt. \"How would you like to\n",
      "come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! There's M. Swann,\" cried my father. \"Let's ask him if he thinks it\n",
      "will be fine to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the\n",
      "unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his\n",
      "marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I\n",
      "followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me\n",
      "while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the\n",
      "dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on\n",
      "ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, M. Swann,\" she said, \"do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she\n",
      "shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,\" said my\n",
      "grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but\n",
      "managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of\n",
      "thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the\n",
      "discovery of their finest lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,\" she said, or\n",
      "rather whispered to Swann. \"It is only a mother who can understand. I am\n",
      "sure that hers would agree with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to\n",
      "think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening,\n",
      "alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to\n",
      "convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should\n",
      "have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the\n",
      "future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss\n",
      "that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding,\n",
      "distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any\n",
      "other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the\n",
      "condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of\n",
      "quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a\n",
      "surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a\n",
      "clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet\n",
      "feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my\n",
      "grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc\n",
      "d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or\n",
      "amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question\n",
      "Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose\n",
      "ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her\n",
      "natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me\n",
      "some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in\n",
      "Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure!\" said her sister Flora, \"but I haven't wasted my time either.\n",
      "I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows Maubant quite\n",
      "well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his\n",
      "parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of\n",
      "M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,\" cried my aunt\n",
      "Céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed\n",
      "forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long;\n",
      "darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann.\n",
      "And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Céline's\n",
      "way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a\n",
      "blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to\n",
      "underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann his\n",
      "having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was\n",
      "embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it would be worth while,\" Flora went on, \"to have this old\n",
      "gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will\n",
      "talk for hours on end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That must be delightful,\" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had\n",
      "unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming\n",
      "passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of\n",
      "Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as\n",
      "it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of\n",
      "that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to\n",
      "extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Molé or of the\n",
      "Comte de Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say!\" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, \"what I was going to tell you\n",
      "has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now,\n",
      "for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a\n",
      "passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in\n",
      "the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little\n",
      "more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well\n",
      "written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism\n",
      "that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the\n",
      "papers very pleasant indeed!\" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that\n",
      "she had read the note about his Corot in the _Figaro_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" aunt Céline went one better. \"When they write about things or\n",
      "people in whom we are interested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't deny it,\" answered Swann in some bewilderment. \"The fault I\n",
      "find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some\n",
      "fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a\n",
      "lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every\n",
      "morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a\n",
      "transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it—oh! I\n",
      "don't know; shall we say Pascal's _Pensées_?\" He articulated the title with\n",
      "an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. \"And then, in the gilt and\n",
      "tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,\" he went on, shewing that\n",
      "contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to\n",
      "affect, \"we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at\n",
      "Cannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had given a fancy dress ball. In\n",
      "that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information'\n",
      "and 'publicity.'\" But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to\n",
      "speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: \"We are\n",
      "having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to\n",
      "these lofty summits,\" and then, turning to my grandfather: \"Well,\n",
      "Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to\n",
      "his sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, 'Never did I find in\n",
      "that coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very\n",
      "different!\" said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as\n",
      "her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both.\n",
      "Céline began to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swann was puzzled, but went on: \"'I cannot say whether it was his\n",
      "ignorance or a trap,' writes Saint-Simon; 'he wished to give his hand to\n",
      "my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandfather was already in ecstasies over \"ignorance or a trap,\" but\n",
      "Miss Céline—the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having arrested\n",
      "the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing—had grown angry.\n",

      "which broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their\n",

      "more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent\n",

      "deadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents\n",
      "gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward\n",
      "of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this\n",
      "crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat\n",
      "arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and\n",
      "due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance\n",
      "expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I\n",
      "called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title\n",
      "less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his nature,\n",
      "which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably\n",
      "prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening,\n",

      "another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon\n",
      "as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother:\n",
      "\"Go and comfort him.\" Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed\n",
      "that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different\n",
      "from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Françoise (who\n",
      "guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma\n",
      "sitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to\n",

      "my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be\n",
      "punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised\n",
      "a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the\n",
      "consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the\n",
      "bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no\n",
      "small degree of pride, either, in Franchise's presence at this return to\n",
      "humane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to\n",
      "my room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep,\n",
      "raised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a\n",
      "sort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to\n",
      "have been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a\n",
      "first concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first\n",
      "step down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first\n",
      "time she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck\n",

      "succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing\n",
      "her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era,\n",
      "must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared now, I\n",

      "prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to\n",
      "disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed\n",
      "to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands\n",
      "and trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me\n",

      "known; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first\n",

      "overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as\n",
      "she saw that I had noticed this, she said to me, with a smile: \"Why, my\n",

      "glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the\n",

      "eliminate altogether their commercial banality, at least to minimise it,\n",
      "to substitute for the bulk of it what was art still, to introduce, as it\n",

      "masterpieces or the beauties of nature, and had there been replaced by a\n",

      "the artist's interpretation. Accordingly, having to reckon again with\n",
      "vulgarity, my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of\n",

      "all the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still\n",
      "smiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards\n",
      "others, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own\n",
      "troubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those seen\n",
      "on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save for\n",
      "herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes, which\n",
      "could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them\n",
      "passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my great-aunt, the\n",

      "conquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean\n",
      "my grandfather from his liqueur-glass—all these were things of the sort\n",
      "to which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at\n",
      "them, to take the tormentor's side with a. happy determination which\n",
      "deludes one into the belief that it is not, really, tormenting; but in\n",
      "those days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my\n",
      "great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her \"Bathilde! Come in and stop\n",
      "your husband from drinking brandy!\" in my cowardice I became at once a\n",
      "man, and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and\n",
      "injustice; I preferred not to see them; I ran up to the top of the house\n",
      "to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the\n",

      "a more special and a baser use, this room, from which, in the daytime, I\n",
      "could see as far as the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time\n",
      "my place of refuge, doubtless because it was the only room whose door Ï\n",
      "was allowed to lock, whenever my occupation was such as required an\n",
      "inviolable solitude; reading or dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of\n",
      "desire. Alas! I little knew that my own lack of will-power, my delicate\n",

      "heavily on my grandmother's mind than any little breach of the rules by\n",
      "her husband, during those endless perambulations, afternoon and evening,\n",
      "in which we used to see passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the\n",
      "heavens, her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with\n",
      "age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn,\n",
      "covered, if she were walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon\n",

      "\n",
      "My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma\n",
      "would come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted\n",
      "for so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in which\n",
      "I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her garden\n",
      "dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited straw,\n",
      "rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment of the\n",
      "keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached the\n",
      "stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as to prolong\n",
      "the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared.\n",
      "Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I longed to\n",
      "call her back, to say to her \"Kiss me just once again,\" but I knew that\n",
      "then she would at once look displeased, for the concession which she made\n",
      "to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of\n",
      "peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies absurd, and\n",
      "she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need, the custom\n",
      "of having her there at all, which was a very different thing from letting\n",
      "the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was\n",
      "already crossing the threshold. And to see her look displeased destroyed\n",
      "all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before, when she\n",
      "bent her loving face down over my bed, and held it out to me like a Host,\n",
      "for an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of\n",
      "her real presence, and with it the power to sleep. But those evenings on\n",
      "which Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared\n",
      "to those on which we had guests to dinner, and therefore she did not come\n",
      "at all. Our 'guests' were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from\n",
      "a few passing strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the\n",
      "house at Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently\n",
      "since his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his\n",
      "wife) and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we\n",
      "sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron\n",
      "table, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and noisy\n",

      "interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out\n",
      "of action by coming in 'without ringing,' but the double peal—timid,\n",
      "oval, gilded—of the visitors' bell, everyone would at once exclaim \"A\n",
      "visitor! Who in the world can it be?\" but they knew quite well that it\n",
      "could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud voice, to set an\n",
      "example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell\n",
      "the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a\n",
      "stranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying\n",
      "things about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother\n",
      "would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an\n",
      "additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove\n",
      "surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to\n",
      "make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother might run her hand\n",
      "through her boy's hair, after the barber had smoothed it down, to make it\n",

      "invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: \"I can hear\n",
      "Swann's voice.\" And, indeed, one could tell him only by his voice, for it\n",
      "was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes,\n",
      "under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red hair, dressed in the\n",
      "Bressant style, because in the garden we used as little light as possible,\n",
      "so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would slip away as though not going\n",
      "for anything in particular, to tell them to bring out the syrups; for my\n",
      "grandmother made a great point, thinking it 'nicer,' of their not being\n",
      "allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary, which we kept for visitors\n",
      "only. Although a far younger man, M. Swann was very much attached to my\n",
      "grandfather, who had been an intimate friend, in his time, of Swann's\n",
      "father, an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing\n",
      "would, it seemed, often check the flow of his spirits and divert the\n",
      "current of his thoughts. Several times in the course of a year I would\n",
      "hear my grandfather tell at table the story, which never varied, of the\n",
      "behaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife, by whose\n",
      "bedside he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him\n",
      "for a long time, hastened to join him at the Swanns' family property on\n",
      "the outskirts of Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping\n",
      "profusely, out of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when\n",
      "the body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park,\n",
      "where there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather\n",
      "by the arm and cried, \"Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be\n",
      "walking here together on such a charming day! Don't you see how pretty\n",
      "they are, all these trees—my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you\n",
      "have never congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don't you\n",
      "feel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive\n",
      "all the same, my dear Amédée!\" And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead\n",
      "wife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire\n",
      "into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away\n",
      "by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he\n",
      "habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind:\n",
      "that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped\n",
      "his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but\n",
      "used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived\n",
      "her, \"It's a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I\n",
      "cannot think of her very much at any one time.\" \"Often, but a little at a\n",
      "time, like poor old Swann,\" became one of my grandfather's favourite\n",
      "phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have\n",
      "assumed that this father of Swann's had been a monster if my grandfather,\n",
      "whom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law\n",
      "and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have\n",
      "been inclined to condemn, had not gone on to exclaim, \"But, after all, he\n",
      "had a heart of gold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, albeit—and especially before his marriage—M. Swann the\n",
      "younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and grandparents\n",
      "never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society\n",
      "which his family had frequented, or that, under the sort of incognito\n",
      "which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring—with the\n",
      "complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their\n",

      "\n",
      "Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the\n",
      "world of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and\n",
      "discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days\n",
      "took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist\n",
      "of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself\n",
      "called to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and\n",
      "nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good' marriage,\n",
      "could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste. M.\n",

      "himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune, as in a list of\n",
      "taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income. We knew the\n",
      "people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew his own\n",
      "associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.' If he knew\n",
      "other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old\n",

      "good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came\n",
      "most faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the\n",
      "people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom\n",

      "all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position, his\n",
      "coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a\n",
      "very simple life, and having always had a craze for 'antiques' and\n",
      "pictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which\n",
      "my grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d'Orléans, a\n",
      "neighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be\n",
      "quartered. \"Are you really a connoisseur, now?\" she would say to him; \"I\n",
      "ask for your own sake, as you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you\n",
      "by the dealers,\" for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical\n",

      "conversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull\n",
      "preciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most\n",
      "minute details, but even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him\n",
      "about art. When challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his\n",
      "admiration for some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and\n",
      "would then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other\n",
      "about the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it\n",
      "had been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to\n",
      "amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure—and he would\n",
      "have a fresh story for us on every occasion—with some one whom we\n",
      "ourselves knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman.\n",
      "These stories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could\n",
      "never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann\n",

      "accompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother's\n",

      "times and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will\n",
      "play with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a\n",
      "penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs\n",

      "unrecognisable shape which began to appear, with my grandmother in its\n",
      "wake, against a background of shadows, and could at last be identified by\n",
      "the sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details\n",
      "of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole,\n",

      "evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the\n",
      "depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not\n",
      "unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together\n",
      "after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during\n",
      "our companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so well\n",
      "lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family,\n",
      "that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living\n",
      "creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know\n",
      "for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from\n",
      "the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann—this\n",
      "early Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of my\n",

      "of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady\n",
      "whom she had known at the Sacré Cœur (and with whom, because of our caste\n",
      "theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of\n",
      "several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous\n",
      "house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephews,\n",
      "the des Laumes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house,\n",
      "which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had\n",
      "advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his\n",
      "daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone\n",
      "to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the\n",
      "staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the\n",
      "girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the\n",
      "finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly\n",
      "independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the\n",
      "tailor had made, saying to Mamma:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sévigné would not have said it better!\" and, by way of contrast, of a\n",
      "nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, he is so common!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in\n",
      "my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared\n",
      "that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we owed to Mme.\n",
      "de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing\n",
      "that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed\n",
      "in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and in allowing members\n",
      "of her family to associate with him. \"How should she know Swann? A lady\n",
      "who, you always made out, was related to Marshal MacMahon!\" This view of\n",
      "Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be\n",
      "confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you\n",
      "might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him justice, he never\n",
      "attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though\n",
      "he came more and more seldom; but from whom they thought they could\n",
      "establish, on the assumption that he had found her there, the circle,\n",
      "unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was\n",
      "one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the\n",
      "Duc de X——, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent\n",
      "statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious\n",
      "to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental\n",
      "share in the private lives of men like Molé, the Duc Pasquier, or the Duc\n",
      "de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who\n",
      "had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in\n",
      "a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates\n",
      "outside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his 'proper\n",
      "station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her\n",
      "that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly\n",
      "relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and\n",
      "store up for their children's benefit, for my great-aunt had actually\n",
      "ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a\n",
      "'Highness' and had thereby stepped down—in her eyes—from the respectable\n",
      "position of a lawyer's son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen\n",
      "or stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn\n",
      "their favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of\n",
      "questioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people\n",
      "whose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my\n",
      "grandmother's two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of\n",
      "character but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not\n",
      "conceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about\n",
      "such trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were\n",
      "incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the\n",
      "'pinchbeck' things of life, even when they had an historic value, or,\n",
      "generally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some\n",
      "object aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest\n",
      "in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday\n",
      "life that their sense of hearing—which had gradually come to understand\n",
      "its own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table,\n",
      "became frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able\n",
      "to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves—would leave its\n",
      "receptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually\n",
      "becoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the\n",
      "attention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm\n",
      "signals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as\n",
      "by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them\n",
      "at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent\n",
      "methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their\n",
      "everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or\n",
      "because they think the whole world a trifle mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with\n",
      "us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my\n",
      "great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the _Figaro_ in which to the\n",
      "name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words,\n",
      "\"from the collection of M. Charles Swann,\" asked: \"Did you see that Swann\n",
      "is 'mentioned' in the _Figaro_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I have always told you,\" said my grandmother, \"that he had plenty of\n",
      "taste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would, of course,\" retorted my great-aunt, \"say anything just to seem\n",
      "different from _us_.\" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with\n",
      "her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the\n",
      "rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale\n",
      "condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she hoped to force\n",
      "us into solidarity with her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to\n",
      "mention to Swann this reference to him in the _Figaro_, my great-aunt\n",
      "dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial,\n",
      "which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no\n",
      "advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should\n",
      "hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and\n",
      "I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's\n",
      "sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a\n",
      "fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious\n",
      "circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to\n",
      "whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing\n",
      "to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of\n",
      "his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood\n",
      "that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very\n",
      "hard for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My father, however, was annoyed: \"No, no; you have the most absurd ideas.\n",
      "It would be utterly ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave rise\n",
      "to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings\n",
      "when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma did not\n",
      "come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with the family:\n",
      "I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and\n",
      "went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others,\n",
      "and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o'clock, when it\n",
      "was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and precious kiss which\n",
      "Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I was in bed and just going\n",
      "to sleep I had to take with me from the dining-room to my own, and to keep\n",
      "inviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its\n",
      "sweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself\n",
      "and evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most\n",
      "pains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it\n",
      "instantly and in public, without even having the time or being properly\n",
      "free to apply to what I was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who\n",
      "compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while\n",
      "they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps\n",
      "over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the\n",
      "recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded\n",
      "shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one\n",
      "another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,\" my grandfather warned\n",
      "his two sisters-in-law; \"you know how good it is, and it is a huge case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, don't start whispering!\" said my great-aunt. \"How would you like to\n",
      "come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! There's M. Swann,\" cried my father. \"Let's ask him if he thinks it\n",
      "will be fine to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the\n",
      "unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his\n",
      "marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I\n",
      "followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me\n",
      "while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the\n",
      "dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on\n",
      "ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, M. Swann,\" she said, \"do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she\n",
      "shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,\" said my\n",
      "grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but\n",
      "managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of\n",
      "thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the\n",
      "discovery of their finest lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,\" she said, or\n",
      "rather whispered to Swann. \"It is only a mother who can understand. I am\n",
      "sure that hers would agree with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to\n",
      "think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening,\n",
      "alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to\n",
      "convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should\n",
      "have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the\n",
      "future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss\n",
      "that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding,\n",
      "distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any\n",
      "other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the\n",
      "condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of\n",
      "quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a\n",
      "surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a\n",
      "clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet\n",
      "feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my\n",
      "grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc\n",
      "d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or\n",
      "amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question\n",
      "Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose\n",
      "ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her\n",
      "natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me\n",
      "some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in\n",
      "Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure!\" said her sister Flora, \"but I haven't wasted my time either.\n",
      "I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows Maubant quite\n",
      "well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his\n",
      "parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of\n",
      "M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,\" cried my aunt\n",
      "Céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed\n",
      "forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long;\n",
      "darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann.\n",
      "And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Céline's\n",
      "way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a\n",
      "blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to\n",
      "underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann his\n",
      "having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was\n",
      "embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it would be worth while,\" Flora went on, \"to have this old\n",
      "gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will\n",
      "talk for hours on end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That must be delightful,\" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had\n",
      "unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming\n",
      "passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of\n",
      "Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as\n",
      "it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of\n",
      "that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to\n",
      "extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Molé or of the\n",
      "Comte de Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say!\" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, \"what I was going to tell you\n",
      "has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now,\n",
      "for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a\n",
      "passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in\n",
      "the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little\n",
      "more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well\n",
      "written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism\n",
      "that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the\n",
      "papers very pleasant indeed!\" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that\n",
      "she had read the note about his Corot in the _Figaro_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" aunt Céline went one better. \"When they write about things or\n",
      "people in whom we are interested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't deny it,\" answered Swann in some bewilderment. \"The fault I\n",
      "find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some\n",
      "fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a\n",
      "lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every\n",
      "morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a\n",
      "transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it—oh! I\n",
      "don't know; shall we say Pascal's _Pensées_?\" He articulated the title with\n",
      "an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. \"And then, in the gilt and\n",
      "tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,\" he went on, shewing that\n",
      "contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to\n",
      "affect, \"we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at\n",
      "Cannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had given a fancy dress ball. In\n",
      "that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information'\n",
      "and 'publicity.'\" But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to\n",
      "speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: \"We are\n",
      "having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to\n",
      "these lofty summits,\" and then, turning to my grandfather: \"Well,\n",
      "Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to\n",
      "his sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, 'Never did I find in\n",
      "that coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very\n",
      "different!\" said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as\n",
      "her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both.\n",
      "Céline began to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swann was puzzled, but went on: \"'I cannot say whether it was his\n",
      "ignorance or a trap,' writes Saint-Simon; 'he wished to give his hand to\n",
      "my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandfather was already in ecstasies over \"ignorance or a trap,\" but\n",
      "Miss Céline—the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having arrested\n",
      "the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing—had grown angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is the\n",
      "point of it? Does he mean that one man isn't as good as another? What\n",
      "difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is\n",
      "intelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his children, your\n",
      "Saint-Simon, if he didn't teach them to shake hands with all honest men.\n",
      "Really and truly, it's abominable. And you dare to quote it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be\n",
      "for him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him the\n",
      "stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: \"Just tell me\n",
      "again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these\n",

      "gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward\n",
      "of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this\n",
      "crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat\n",
      "arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and\n",
      "due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance\n",
      "expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I\n",
      "called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title\n",
      "less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his nature,\n",
      "which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably\n",

      "\"Go and comfort him.\" Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed\n",
      "that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different\n",
      "from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Françoise (who\n",

      "punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised\n",
      "a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the\n",
      "consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the\n",
      "bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no\n",
      "small degree of pride, either, in Franchise's presence at this return to\n",

      "first concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first\n",
      "step down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first\n",

      "prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to\n",
      "disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed\n",
      "to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands\n",

      "overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as\n",

      "conquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean\n",
      "my grandfather from his liqueur-glass—all these were things of the sort\n",
      "to which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at\n",

      "example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell\n",
      "the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a\n",
      "stranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying\n",
      "things about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother\n",
      "would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an\n",
      "additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove\n",
      "surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to\n",

      "the body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park,\n",
      "where there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather\n",
      "by the arm and cried, \"Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be\n",

      "habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind:\n",
      "that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped\n",
      "his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but\n",
      "used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived\n",
      "her, \"It's a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I\n",

      "Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the\n",

      "discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days\n",
      "took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist\n",
      "of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself\n",
      "called to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and\n",
      "nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good' marriage,\n",

      "all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position, his\n",

      "would then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other\n",
      "about the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it\n",
      "had been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to\n",

      "\n",
      "As she was the only member of our family who could be described as a\n",

      "into the cave, resplendent with its unsuspected treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day when he had come to see us after dinner in Paris, and had begged\n",

      "Altogether, my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony. Since she was\n",

      "summer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden, and\n",
      "that from each of his visits to Italy he should bring back some\n",
      "photographs of old masters for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted a\n",
      "recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of our big\n",
      "dinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not seeming of\n",
      "sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who might be in our\n",

      "the House of France, \"Gentlemen, you and I will never know, will we, and\n",
      "don't want to, do we?\" my great-aunt would say tartly to Swann, who had,\n",
      "perhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his pocket; she would make him play\n",
      "accompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother's\n",
      "sister sang; manipulating this creature, so rare and refined at other\n",
      "times and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will\n",
      "play with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a\n",
      "penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs\n",
      "of those days differed hugely from, the Swann created in my great-aunt's\n",

      "unrecognisable shape which began to appear, with my grandmother in its\n",
      "wake, against a background of shadows, and could at last be identified by\n",
      "the sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details\n",
      "of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole,\n",
      "which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in\n",
      "an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created\n",

      "have already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we\n",
      "compose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In\n",
      "the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to\n",
      "follow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in the\n",
      "sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent\n",
      "envelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our\n",
      "own ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no\n",
      "doubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family\n",
      "had left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his\n",
      "daily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other\n",
      "people, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and\n",
      "stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but they\n",
      "contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been\n",
      "evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the\n",
      "depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not\n",
      "unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together\n",
      "after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during\n",
      "our companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so well\n",
      "lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family,\n",
      "that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living\n",
      "creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know\n",
      "for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from\n",
      "the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann—this\n",
      "early Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of my\n",
      "childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like his successor than he is\n",
      "like the other people I knew at that time, as though one's life were a\n",
      "series of galleries in which all the portraits of any one period had a\n",
      "marked family likeness, the same (so to speak) tonality—this early Swann\n",
      "abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree,\n",
      "of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady\n",
      "whom she had known at the Sacré Cœur (and with whom, because of our caste\n",
      "theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of\n",
      "several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous\n",
      "house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephews,\n",
      "the des Laumes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house,\n",
      "which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had\n",
      "advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his\n",
      "daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone\n",
      "to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the\n",
      "staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the\n",
      "girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the\n",
      "finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly\n",
      "independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the\n",
      "tailor had made, saying to Mamma:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sévigné would not have said it better!\" and, by way of contrast, of a\n",
      "nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, he is so common!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in\n",
      "my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared\n",
      "that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we owed to Mme.\n",
      "de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing\n",
      "that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed\n",
      "in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and in allowing members\n",
      "of her family to associate with him. \"How should she know Swann? A lady\n",
      "who, you always made out, was related to Marshal MacMahon!\" This view of\n",
      "Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be\n",
      "confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you\n",
      "might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him justice, he never\n",
      "attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though\n",
      "he came more and more seldom; but from whom they thought they could\n",
      "establish, on the assumption that he had found her there, the circle,\n",
      "unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was\n",
      "one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the\n",
      "Duc de X——, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent\n",
      "statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious\n",
      "to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental\n",
      "share in the private lives of men like Molé, the Duc Pasquier, or the Duc\n",
      "de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who\n",
      "had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in\n",
      "a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates\n",
      "outside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his 'proper\n",
      "station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her\n",
      "that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly\n",
      "relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and\n",
      "store up for their children's benefit, for my great-aunt had actually\n",
      "ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a\n",
      "'Highness' and had thereby stepped down—in her eyes—from the respectable\n",
      "position of a lawyer's son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen\n",
      "or stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn\n",
      "their favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of\n",
      "questioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people\n",
      "whose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my\n",
      "grandmother's two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of\n",
      "character but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not\n",
      "conceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about\n",
      "such trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were\n",
      "incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the\n",
      "'pinchbeck' things of life, even when they had an historic value, or,\n",
      "generally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some\n",
      "object aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest\n",
      "in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday\n",
      "life that their sense of hearing—which had gradually come to understand\n",
      "its own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table,\n",
      "became frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able\n",
      "to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves—would leave its\n",
      "receptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually\n",
      "becoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the\n",
      "attention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm\n",
      "signals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as\n",
      "by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them\n",
      "at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent\n",
      "methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their\n",
      "everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or\n",
      "because they think the whole world a trifle mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with\n",
      "us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my\n",
      "great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the _Figaro_ in which to the\n",
      "name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words,\n",
      "\"from the collection of M. Charles Swann,\" asked: \"Did you see that Swann\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I have always told you,\" said my grandmother, \"that he had plenty of\n",
      "taste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would, of course,\" retorted my great-aunt, \"say anything just to seem\n",
      "different from _us_.\" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with\n",
      "her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the\n",
      "rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale\n",
      "condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she hoped to force\n",
      "us into solidarity with her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to\n",
      "mention to Swann this reference to him in the _Figaro_, my great-aunt\n",
      "dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial,\n",
      "which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no\n",
      "advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should\n",
      "hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and\n",
      "I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's\n",
      "sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a\n",
      "fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious\n",
      "circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to\n",
      "whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing\n",
      "to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of\n",
      "his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood\n",
      "that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very\n",
      "hard for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My father, however, was annoyed: \"No, no; you have the most absurd ideas.\n",
      "It would be utterly ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave rise\n",
      "to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings\n",

      "I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and\n",
      "went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others,\n",
      "and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o'clock, when it\n",

      "inviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its\n",
      "sweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself\n",
      "and evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most\n",
      "pains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it\n",

      "compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while\n",
      "they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps\n",
      "over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the\n",
      "recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded\n",
      "shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one\n",
      "another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,\" my grandfather warned\n",
      "his two sisters-in-law; \"you know how good it is, and it is a huge case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, don't start whispering!\" said my great-aunt. \"How would you like to\n",
      "come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! There's M. Swann,\" cried my father. \"Let's ask him if he thinks it\n",
      "will be fine to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the\n",
      "unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his\n",
      "marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I\n",
      "followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me\n",
      "while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the\n",
      "dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on\n",
      "ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, M. Swann,\" she said, \"do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she\n",
      "shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,\" said my\n",
      "grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but\n",
      "managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of\n",
      "thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the\n",
      "discovery of their finest lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,\" she said, or\n",
      "rather whispered to Swann. \"It is only a mother who can understand. I am\n",
      "sure that hers would agree with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to\n",
      "think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening,\n",
      "alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to\n",
      "convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should\n",
      "have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the\n",
      "future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss\n",
      "that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding,\n",
      "distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any\n",
      "other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the\n",
      "condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of\n",
      "quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a\n",
      "surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a\n",
      "clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet\n",
      "feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my\n",
      "grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc\n",
      "d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or\n",
      "amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question\n",
      "Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose\n",
      "ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her\n",
      "natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me\n",
      "some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in\n",
      "Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure!\" said her sister Flora, \"but I haven't wasted my time either.\n",
      "I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows Maubant quite\n",
      "well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his\n",
      "parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of\n",
      "M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,\" cried my aunt\n",
      "Céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed\n",
      "forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long;\n",
      "darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann.\n",
      "And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Céline's\n",
      "way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a\n",
      "blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to\n",
      "underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann his\n",
      "having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was\n",
      "embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it would be worth while,\" Flora went on, \"to have this old\n",
      "gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will\n",
      "talk for hours on end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That must be delightful,\" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had\n",
      "unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming\n",
      "passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of\n",
      "Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as\n",
      "it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of\n",
      "that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to\n",
      "extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Molé or of the\n",
      "Comte de Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say!\" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, \"what I was going to tell you\n",
      "has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now,\n",
      "for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a\n",
      "passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in\n",
      "the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little\n",
      "more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well\n",
      "written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism\n",
      "that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the\n",
      "papers very pleasant indeed!\" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that\n",
      "she had read the note about his Corot in the _Figaro_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" aunt Céline went one better. \"When they write about things or\n",
      "people in whom we are interested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't deny it,\" answered Swann in some bewilderment. \"The fault I\n",
      "find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some\n",
      "fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a\n",
      "lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every\n",
      "morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a\n",
      "transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it—oh! I\n",
      "don't know; shall we say Pascal's _Pensées_?\" He articulated the title with\n",
      "an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. \"And then, in the gilt and\n",
      "tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,\" he went on, shewing that\n",
      "contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to\n",
      "affect, \"we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at\n",
      "Cannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had given a fancy dress ball. In\n",
      "that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information'\n",
      "and 'publicity.'\" But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to\n",
      "speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: \"We are\n",
      "having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to\n",
      "these lofty summits,\" and then, turning to my grandfather: \"Well,\n",
      "Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to\n",
      "his sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, 'Never did I find in\n",
      "that coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very\n",
      "different!\" said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as\n",
      "her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both.\n",
      "Céline began to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swann was puzzled, but went on: \"'I cannot say whether it was his\n",
      "ignorance or a trap,' writes Saint-Simon; 'he wished to give his hand to\n",
      "my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandfather was already in ecstasies over \"ignorance or a trap,\" but\n",
      "Miss Céline—the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having arrested\n",
      "the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing—had grown angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is the\n",
      "point of it? Does he mean that one man isn't as good as another? What\n",
      "difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is\n",
      "intelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his children, your\n",
      "Saint-Simon, if he didn't teach them to shake hands with all honest men.\n",
      "Really and truly, it's abominable. And you dare to quote it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be\n",
      "for him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him the\n",
      "stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: \"Just tell me\n",
      "again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these\n",
      "occasions. Oh, yes:\n",
      "\n",
      "What virtues, Lord, Thou makest us abhor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good, that is, very good.\"\n",

      "I never took my eyes off my mother. I knew that when they were at table I\n",
      "should not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner-time, and\n",
      "that Mamma, for fear of annoying my father, would not allow me to give her\n",
      "in public the series of kisses that she would have had in my room. And so\n",
      "I promised myself that in the dining-room, as they began to eat and drink\n",
      "and as I felt the hour approach, I would put beforehand into this kiss,\n",
      "which was bound to be so brief and stealthy in execution, everything that\n",
      "my own efforts could put into it: would look out very carefully first the\n",
      "exact spot on her cheek where I would imprint it, and would so prepare my\n",
      "thoughts that I might be able, thanks to these mental preliminaries, to\n",
      "consecrate the whole of the minute Mamma would allow me to the sensation\n",

      "short sittings only prepares his palette, and from what he remembers and\n",
      "from rough notes does in advance everything which he possibly can do in\n",
      "the sitter's absence. But to-night, before the dinner-bell had sounded, my\n",
      "grandfather said with unconscious cruelty: \"The little man looks tired;\n",
      "he'd better go up to bed. Besides, we are dining late to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And my father, who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in\n",
      "observing the letter of a treaty, went on: \"Yes, run along; to bed with\n",

      "\n",
      "I would have kissed Mamma then and there, but at that moment the\n",

      "my heart's desire, which was to return to my mother, since she had not, by\n",
      "her kiss, given my heart leave to accompany me forth. That hateful\n",
      "staircase, up which I always passed with such dismay, gave out a smell of\n",
      "varnish which had to some extent absorbed, made definite and fixed the\n",
      "special quality of sorrow that I felt each evening, and made it perhaps\n",
      "even more cruel to my sensibility because, when it assumed this olfactory\n",
      "guise, my intellect was powerless to resist it. When we have gone to sleep\n",
      "with a maddening toothache and are conscious of it only as a little girl\n",
      "whom we attempt, time after time, to pull out of the water, or as a line\n",
      "of Molière which we repeat incessantly to ourselves, it is a great relief\n",
      "to wake up, so that our intelligence can disentangle the idea of toothache\n",
      "from any artificial semblance of heroism or rhythmic cadence. It was the\n",
      "precise converse of this relief which I felt when my anguish at having to\n",
      "go up to my room invaded my consciousness in a manner infinitely more\n",
      "rapid, instantaneous almost, a manner at once insidious and brutal as I\n",
      "breathed in—a far more poisonous thing than any moral penetration—the\n",
      "peculiar smell of the varnish upon that staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in my room I had to stop every loophole, to close the shutters, to\n",
      "dig my own grave as I turned down the bed-clothes, to wrap myself in the\n",
      "shroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which\n",
      "had been placed there because, on summer nights, I was too hot among the\n",
      "rep curtains of the four-poster, I was stirred to revolt, and attempted\n",
      "the desperate stratagem of a condemned prisoner. I wrote to my mother\n",
      "begging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not put\n",
      "in writing. My fear was that Françoise, my aunt's cook who used to be put\n",
      "in charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my note. I had\n",
      "a suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to my mother when there\n",
      "was a stranger in the room would appear flatly inconceivable, just as it\n",
      "would be for the door-keeper of a theatre to hand a letter to an actor\n",
      "upon the stage. For things which might or might not be done she possessed\n",
      "a code at once imperious, abundant, subtle, and uncompromising on points\n",
      "themselves imperceptible or irrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to\n",
      "those ancient laws which combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of\n",
      "infants at the breast with prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement,\n",
      "against \"seething the kid in his mother's milk,\" or \"eating of the sinew\n",
      "which is upon the hollow of the thigh.\" This code, if one could judge it\n",
      "by the sudden obstinacy which she would put into her refusal to carry out\n",
      "certain of our instructions, seemed to have foreseen such social\n",
      "complications and refinements of fashion as nothing in Françoise's\n",
      "surroundings or in her career as a servant in a village household could\n",
      "have put into her head; and we were obliged to assume that there was\n",

      "myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for the family\n",

      "stranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have found\n",
      "touching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her lips,\n",
      "because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter it, and\n",
      "which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred character\n",
      "in which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect of making her\n",

      "keener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs imperceptible\n",
      "by the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that we might wish\n",
      "to conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five minutes as though\n",
      "an examination of the paper itself and the look of my handwriting could\n",
      "enlighten her as to the nature of the contents, or tell her to which\n",
      "article of her code she ought to refer the matter. Then she went out with\n",

      "you go and undress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the\n",

      "went quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I\n",
      "could hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety,\n",
      "but with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light\n",
      "coming upwards, from Mamma's candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw\n",
      "myself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not\n",
      "realising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression of\n",
      "anger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used to\n",
      "go for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences than\n",
      "this. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that further\n",
      "intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility, and that might\n",
      "perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as indicating that, with\n",
      "such a punishment as was in store for me, mere silence, and even anger,\n",
      "were relatively puerile.\n",
      "\n",
      "A word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one\n",
      "converses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice; the\n",
      "kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which would\n",
      "have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being angry with\n",
      "him for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the dressing-room,\n",
      "where he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid the 'scene' which\n",
      "he would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice half-stifled by her\n",

      "also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope that\n",
      "my mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must if she\n",
      "continued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: \"Go back to your\n",
      "room. I will come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Too late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one\n",
      "heard me, \"I am done for!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do\n",
      "things which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters\n",
      "granted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to\n",
      "'Principles,' and because in his sight there were no such things as\n",
      "'Rights of Man.' For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at\n",
      "all, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular\n",
      "walk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of it\n",
      "was a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening, long\n",
      "before the appointed hour he would snap out: \"Run along up to bed now; no\n",
      "excuses!\" But then again, simply because he was devoid of principles (in\n",
      "my grandmother's sense), so he could not, properly speaking, be called\n",
      "inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and\n",
      "surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without some\n",
      "embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: \"Go along with him, then;\n",
      "you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep, so stay in his room for\n",
      "a little. I don't need anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But dear,\" my mother answered timidly, \"whether or not I feel like sleep\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There's no question of making him accustomed,\" said my father, with a\n",
      "shrug of the shoulders; \"you can see quite well that the child is unhappy.\n",
      "After all, we aren't gaolers. You'll end by making him ill, and a lot of\n",
      "good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell Françoise to make\n",
      "up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the rest of the night. I'm\n",
      "off to bed, anyhow; I'm not nervous like you. Good night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my\n",
      "sentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring to\n",
      "move; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white\n",
      "nightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere in\n",
      "which, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up his\n",
      "head, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli which\n",
      "M. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself away from\n",
      "Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase,\n",
      "up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb, was long\n",
      "ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have perished which, I\n",
      "imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have arisen, giving\n",
      "birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have\n",
      "foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of comprehension. It is a long\n",
      "time, too, since my father has been able to tell Mamma to \"Go with the\n",
      "child.\" Never again will such hours be possible for me. But of late I have\n",
      "been increasingly able to catch, if I listen attentively, the sound of the\n",
      "sobs which I had the strength to control in my father's presence, and\n",
      "which broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their\n",
      "echo has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and\n",
      "more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent\n",
      "bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the\n",
      "streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until\n",
      "they sound out again through the silent evening air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so\n",
      "deadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents\n",
      "gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward\n",
      "of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this\n",
      "crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat\n",
      "arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and\n",
      "due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance\n",
      "expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I\n",
      "called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title\n",
      "less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his nature,\n",
      "which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably\n",
      "prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening,\n",
      "a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but they loved me\n",
      "enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering, which they hoped to\n",
      "teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to\n",
      "strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of\n",
      "another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon\n",
      "as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother:\n",
      "\"Go and comfort him.\" Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed\n",
      "that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different\n",
      "from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Françoise (who\n",
      "guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma\n",
      "sitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to\n",
      "her: \"But, Madame, what is little Master crying for?\" she replied: \"Why,\n",
      "Françoise, he doesn't know himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed\n",
      "for me quickly and then go off to your own.\" And thus for the first time\n",
      "my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be\n",
      "punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised\n",
      "a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the\n",
      "consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the\n",
      "bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no\n",
      "small degree of pride, either, in Franchise's presence at this return to\n",
      "humane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to\n",
      "my room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep,\n",
      "raised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a\n",
      "sort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to\n",
      "have been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a\n",
      "first concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first\n",
      "step down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first\n",
      "time she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck\n",
      "me that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had\n",
      "succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing\n",
      "her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era,\n",
      "must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared now, I\n",
      "should have said to Mamma: \"No, I don't want you; you mustn't sleep here.\"\n",
      "But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what would be called\n",
      "nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my\n",
      "grandmother's nature, and I knew that now the mischief was done she would\n",
      "prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to\n",
      "disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed\n",
      "to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands\n",
      "and trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me\n",
      "that this should not have happened; her anger would have been less\n",
      "difficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not\n",
      "known; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first\n",
      "wrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head.\n",
      "This thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw that Mamma, who had never\n",
      "allowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me, was suddenly\n",
      "overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as\n",
      "she saw that I had noticed this, she said to me, with a smile: \"Why, my\n",
      "little buttercup, my little canary-boy, he's going to make Mamma as silly\n",
      "as himself if this goes on. Look, since you can't sleep, and Mamma can't\n",
      "either, we mustn't go on in this stupid way; we must do something; I'll\n",
      "get one of your books.\" But I had none there. \"Would you like me to get\n",
      "out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your\n",
      "birthday? Just think it over first, and don't be disappointed if there is\n",
      "nothing new for you then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books in\n",
      "which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was wrapped,\n",
      "any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this first\n",
      "glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the\n",
      "paint-box of last New Year's Day and the silkworms of the year before. It\n",
      "contained _La Mare au Diable_, _François le Champi_, _La Petite Fadette_,\n",
      "and _Les Maîtres Sonneurs_. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had\n",
      "at first chosen Mussel's poems, a volume of Rousseau, and _Indiana_; for\n",
      "while she considered light reading as unwholesome as sweets and cakes, she\n",
      "did not reflect that the strong breath of genius must have upon the very\n",

      "whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with\n",
      "outside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards,\n",
      "were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw\n",

      "then her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who\n",
      "now never 'came down,' but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of\n",
      "grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious\n",
      "observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which\n",
      "ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pré (as distinct from the\n",
      "Petit-Pré, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets\n",
      "met) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone\n",
      "before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by\n",
      "some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he\n",
      "had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt's life was now practically\n",
      "confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the\n",
      "afternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms of that country\n",
      "order which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are\n",
      "illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see)\n",
      "fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from\n",
      "their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life,\n",
      "invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere\n",
      "holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by\n",
      "circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already\n",
      "humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly,\n",
      "blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the\n",
      "store-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic\n",
      "smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet\n",
      "savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving\n",
      "smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase\n",
      "of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to\n",
      "the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst\n",
      "them. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a\n",
      "silence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a\n",
      "sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly\n",
      "still, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I\n",
      "had just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good\n",
      "day I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the\n",
      "sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire,\n",
      "lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room\n",
      "and everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of\n",
      "those great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the\n",
      "canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in\n",
      "the world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a\n",
      "catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the\n",
      "comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk\n",
      "and the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted\n",
      "antimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with\n",
      "which the air of the room, was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny\n",
      "freshness of the morning had already 'raised' and started to 'set,' puffed\n",
      "them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible\n",
      "though not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which,\n",
      "barely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable,\n",
      "but also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the\n",

      "never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was\n",
      "something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might\n",
      "displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when\n",
      "alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for\n",
      "her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would\n",
      "make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable;\n",
      "besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the\n",
      "least of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a\n",
      "Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and,\n",
      "failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to\n",
      "promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole\n",
      "form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking\n",
      "aloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the\n",
      "adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: \"I must not\n",
      "forget that I never slept a wink\"—for \"never sleeping a wink\" was her\n",
      "great claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our\n",
      "household vocabulary; in the morning Françoise would not 'call' her, but\n",
      "would simply 'come to' her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a\n",
      "nap, we used to say just that she wished to 'be quiet' or to 'rest'; and\n",
      "when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say \"what made me\n",

      "herself.\n",

      "After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Françoise would be\n",
      "making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling 'upset,' she would ask instead\n",
      "for her 'tisane,' and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist's\n",
      "little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for\n",
      "infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a\n",
      "fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a\n",
      "painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative\n",
      "poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed\n",
      "those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the\n",
      "transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of\n",
      "roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the\n",
      "material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details—the charming\n",
      "prodigality of the chemist—details which would have been eliminated from\n",
      "an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished\n",
      "to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that\n",
      "these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming\n",
      "from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they\n",
      "were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And\n",
      "as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in\n",
      "these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time;\n",
      "but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms\n",
      "among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden\n",
      "roses—marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of\n",
      "a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which\n",
      "had and those which had not been 'in bloom'—shewed me that these were\n",
      "petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package had\n",
      "embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their\n",
      "colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which\n",
      "was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower.\n",
      "Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she\n",
      "would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of\n",
      "which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood,\n",

      "found her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she\n",
      "needed for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to\n",
      "keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her\n",
      "bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and\n",
      "would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life,\n",
      "like a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray,\n",
      "which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Françoise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me\n",
      "away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad\n",
      "brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet\n",
      "have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the\n",
      "points of a crown of thorns-er the beads of a rosary, and she would say to\n",
      "me: \"Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and\n",

      "Françoise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not at\n",
      "that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours,\n",
      "was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent\n",
      "in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to\n",
      "Combray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in Paris\n",
      "with her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on New Year's\n",
      "Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put a five-franc\n",
      "piece in my hand and said: \"Now, be careful. Don't make any mistake. Wait\n",
      "until you hear me say 'Good morning, Françoise,' and I touch your arm\n",
      "before you give it to her.\" No sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark\n",
      "hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff\n",
      "and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of\n",
      "a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect,\n",
      "framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in\n",
      "its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we\n",
      "could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity,\n",
      "blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the\n",
      "most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward.\n",
      "Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: \"Good morning,\n",
      "Françoise.\" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin,\n",
      "which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we\n",
      "had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise.\n",
      "We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed\n",
      "the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener\n",
      "relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family'\n",
      "(for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites\n",
      "the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh\n",
      "charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would\n",
      "she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so\n",
      "bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was\n",
      "often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her\n",
      "nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to\n",
      "make of him, and whether he took after his granny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Françoise\n",
      "was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would\n",
      "speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and\n",
      "their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had guessed that Françoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and\n",
      "that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the\n",
      "two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when\n",
      "Françoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to\n",
      "her, with a smile: \"Tell me, Françoise, if Julien has had to go away, and\n",
      "you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will\n",
      "make the best of it, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Françoise answered, laughing: \"Madame knows everything; Madame is\n",
      "worse than the X-rays\" (she pronounced 'x' with an affectation of\n",
      "difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman's,\n",
      "daring to employ a scientific term) \"they brought here for Mme. Octave,\n",
      "which see what is in your heart\"—and she went off, disturbed that anyone\n",
      "should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in\n",

      "feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows,\n",

      "active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o'clock in\n",
      "the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills\n",
      "seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did\n",
      "everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well\n",
      "or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the\n",
      "only one of my aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black\n",
      "coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants\n",
      "who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger,\n",
      "doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew\n",
      "him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of\n",
      "him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will\n",
      "be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to\n",
      "those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real\n",
      "capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that\n",
      "slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often\n",
      "conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can\n",

      "material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his\n",

      "find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so\n",
      "simple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her\n",

      "by these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity,\n",
      "all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for,\n",
      "like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or\n",
      "to enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their\n",
      "gold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious\n",

      "awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he\n",
      "would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him,\n",
      "with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression\n",
      "upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my\n",
      "gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours\n",
      "later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as\n",
      "giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with\n",
      "which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full\n",
      "account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In\n",
      "doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How\n",
      "could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could\n",
      "not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I\n",
      "myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask\n",
      "us to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been\n",
      "prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this\n",
      "woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for\n",
      "ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people\n",
      "were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific\n",
      "reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the\n",
      "least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of\n",
      "the acquaintance I had made at my uncle's I should at the same time\n",
      "transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the\n",
      "introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely\n",
      "different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to\n",
      "form their estimate of my uncle's conduct. My father and grandfather had\n",
      "'words' with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days\n",
      "later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage,\n",
      "Î felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should\n",
      "have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I\n",
      "considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and\n",
      "petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew\n",
      "him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from\n",
      "so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that,\n",
      "in doing so I was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and\n",
      "though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes\n",
      "on him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept shut)\n",

      "water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,\" I would then decide to go\n",
      "indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The\n",
      "kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which\n",
      "an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity\n",
      "and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in\n",
      "which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl\n",
      "there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of\n",
      "asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor\n",
      "sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray\n",
      "for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Françoise allowed her to run\n",
      "so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she\n",
      "was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious\n",
      "casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be\n",
      "detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the\n",
      "cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his\n",
      "paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who\n",
      "pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid\n",
      "he would say: \"Well, how goes it with Giotto's Charity?\" And indeed the\n",
      "poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her,\n",
      "even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did\n",
      "distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons\n",
      "rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can\n",
      "see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another\n",
      "respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by\n",
      "the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to\n",
      "understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression\n",
      "of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an\n",
      "ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion\n",
      "of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed\n",
      "in the Arena beneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose\n",
      "portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that\n",
      "virtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have\n",
      "found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the\n",
      "painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her\n",
      "feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to\n",
      "extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of\n",
      "sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to\n",
      "God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up\n",
      "a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one\n",
      "who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The\n",
      "'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in\n",
      "this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented\n",
      "with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so\n",
      "huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of\n",
      "her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who is filling a\n",
      "balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter,\n",

      "myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name\n",
      "of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the _Nuit d'Octobre_, he had burst\n",
      "out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of\n",
      "warning: \"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He\n",

      "bound to admit, natheless,\" he added graciously, \"that he, and even the\n",
      "man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is\n",

      "found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is\n",
      "a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended,\n",

      "its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle,\n",
      "indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a\n",

      "impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has\n",

      "fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism,\n",

      "objected on principle—indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish\n",
      "extraction—had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were\n",
      "not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new\n",

      "from _La Juive_, or else \"Israel, break thy chain,\" singing the tune\n",
      "alone, of course, to an \"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be\n",

      "Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often\n",
      "as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only\n",

      "\n",
      "These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will\n",
      "whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for\n",
      "other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in\n",
      "with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I\n",
      "can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \"Sir, I am absolutely\n",
      "incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart\n",
      "from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me\n",
      "of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor boy,\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \"your friend is out of\n",
      "his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As if\n",
      "there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when\n",
      "she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped\n",
      "the tears from his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\" she observed to me. \"Why he\n",
      "doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a\n",
      "half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made\n",
      "not the least apology, saying merely: \"I never allow myself to be\n",
      "influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by\n",
      "the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly\n",
      "reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I\n",
      "am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more\n",
      "pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the\n",
      "umbrella and the watch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was,\n",
      "of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they\n",
      "had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my\n",
      "grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either\n",
      "instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive\n",
      "emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct\n",
      "of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our\n",
      "friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have\n",
      "a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in\n",
      "these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred\n",
      "to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more\n",
      "than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to\n",
      "give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit\n",
      "because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection,\n",
      "but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any\n",
      "single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the\n",
      "duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales\n",
      "to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from\n",
      "the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my\n",
      "great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a\n",
      "niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in\n",
      "which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was\n",
      "her next-of-kin, and it was the 'proper thing' to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the\n",
      "insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely\n",
      "meaningless' beauty of _La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë_ tired me more\n",
      "and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with\n",
      "him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he\n",
      "would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same\n",
      "night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great\n",
      "influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more\n",
      "unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there\n",
      "was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone\n",
      "on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that\n",
      "my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger days, and had\n",
      "been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing on so important\n",
      "a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was\n",
      "not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me\n",
      "with extreme coldness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head\n",
      "and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment\n",
      "'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style\n",
      "had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of\n",
      "his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story\n",
      "alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman\n",
      "at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that\n",
      "we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which\n",
      "he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a\n",
      "prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and\n",
      "elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would\n",
      "begin to speak of the \"vain dream of life,\" of the \"inexhaustible torrent\n",
      "of fair forms,\" of the \"sterile, splendid torture of understanding and\n",
      "loving,\" of the \"moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming\n",
      "and venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he would express a whole\n",
      "system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the\n",
      "inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping\n",
      "which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that\n",
      "imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of\n",
      "Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled\n",
      "me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage\n",
      "bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some\n",
      "innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all\n",
      "obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what\n",
      "had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste\n",
      "for uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist\n",
      "philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my\n",
      "having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no\n",
      "longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in\n",
      "one of Bergotte's works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in\n",
      "outline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the 'ideal passage' of\n",
      "Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier,\n",
      "similar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density\n",
      "and volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was by no means Bergotte's sole admirer; he was the favourite writer\n",
      "also of a friend of my mother's, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du\n",
      "Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte's\n",
      "latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a\n",
      "park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that\n",
      "taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally\n",
      "acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and\n",
      "America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement,\n",
      "but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would seem, what Dr.\n",
      "du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I\n",
      "liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and\n",
      "certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such\n",
      "prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and\n",
      "also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was\n",
      "almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his\n",
      "principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some\n",
      "great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off\n",
      "his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer,\n",
      "would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes,\n",
      "remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a\n",
      "rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious\n",
      "when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no\n",
      "precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where\n",
      "it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites\n",
      "also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even\n",
      "disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he\n",
      "spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of\n",
      "pine-forests or of hailstorms, of _Notre-Dame de Paris_, of _Athalie_, or\n",
      "of _Phèdre_, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode\n",
      "and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe\n",
      "contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless\n",
      "to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might\n",
      "have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and\n",
      "especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of\n",
      "seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon\n",
      "some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea,\n",
      "because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed\n",
      "that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon\n",
      "almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no\n",
      "doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from\n",
      "an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced\n",
      "that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected\n",
      "spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to\n",
      "find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own\n",
      "mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity\n",
      "had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be\n",
      "beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte\n",
      "would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I\n",
      "was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so\n",
      "concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of\n",
      "mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later\n",
      "years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some\n",
      "of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to\n",
      "go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in\n",
      "Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I\n",
      "could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety\n",
      "that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my\n",
      "mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life,' I had no\n",
      "time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read!\n",
      "But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really\n",
      "liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were\n",
      "themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but\n",
      "was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon\n",
      "similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of\n",
      "their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and\n",
      "self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for\n",
      "such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare\n",
      "for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I\n",
      "had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family\n",
      "servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of\n",
      "irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother\n",
      "about Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought\n",
      "not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which\n",
      "were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to\n",
      "make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Françoise\n",
      "and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have\n",
      "sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief that he would find them\n",
      "quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own\n",
      "humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I\n",
      "had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in\n",
      "my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the\n",
      "arms of a long-lost father.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and\n",
      "disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any\n",
      "consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my\n",
      "brain, with rather more _dolce_, rather more _lento_ than he himself had,\n",
      "perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with\n",
      "something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than\n",
      "anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged\n",
      "myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age\n",
      "when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called\n",
      "'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but\n",
      "simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I\n",
      "had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow\n",
      "there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the\n",
      "despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend\n",
      "speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by Swann,\n",

      "it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been\n",

      "\n",

      "my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when\n",

      "riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins\n",
      "slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so discreetly passed\n",
      "that Françoise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to\n",
      "have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already\n",
      "enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that\n",
      "the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid\n",

      "men, on account of my aunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits\n",
      "from the Curé, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which\n",
      "she consumed. Françoise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had\n",
      "control over my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her\n",
      "highest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers\n",
      "with a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in\n",
      "what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to\n",
      "give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she\n",
      "felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's presents,\n",
      "could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account.\n",

      "Françoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and\n",
      "brilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and\n",
      "paid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile.\n",
      "But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of\n",
      "courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of\n",

      "better than myself,\" people whom she despised even more if they did not\n",
      "address her always as \"Mme. Françoise,\" just to shew that they considered\n",
      "themselves to be 'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her\n",
      "warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling\n",
      "money away with both hands (or so, at least, Françoise believed) on\n",
      "undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself\n",

      "mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at\n",
      "the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to\n",

      "in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like\n",

      "of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the\n",

      "Françoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning,\n",
      "her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning,\n",
      "my mother said to me: \"Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the\n",
      "other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing,\n",
      "in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip\n",
      "away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her\n",

      "first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just\n",
      "escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she\n",
      "was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or\n",
      "to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and\n",
      "to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of\n",
      "joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life\n",
      "shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with\n",

      "contented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or\n",
      "anyone's else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and\n",
      "heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my\n",
      "aunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include\n",
      "those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical\n",
      "form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the\n",
      "greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as\n",
      "Françoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin,\n",
      "the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my\n",
      "aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her\n",
      "general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so\n",
      "well 'routined' to it, as Françoise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she\n",
      "had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have\n",
      "'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her\n",
      "luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of\n",
      "luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and\n",
      "rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour\n",
      "to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a\n",
      "few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance,\n",
      "followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The\n",
      "return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences,\n",
      "intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and\n",
      "stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the\n",
      "favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which\n",
      "can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a\n",
      "nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic\n",
      "mind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save\n",
      "for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call\n",
      "to one another good-humouredly, cordially, patriotically, \"Hurry up;\n",
      "there's no time to be lost; don't forget, it's Saturday!\" while my aunt,\n",
      "gossiping with Françoise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer\n",
      "than usual, would say, \"You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing\n",
      "that it's Saturday.\" If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled\n",
      "out a watch and said, \"I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\"\n",
      "everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once:\n",
      "\"Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's\n",
      "Saturday?\" And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and\n",
      "reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt Léonie about this absurd\n",
      "mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a\n",
      "change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would\n",
      "blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we\n",
      "were late in starting for our walk, said, \"What, only two o'clock!\"\n",
      "feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of\n",
      "Saint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the\n",
      "highways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or\n",
      "on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler\n",
      "had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where\n",
      "only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would\n",

      "which used to cause Françoise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that\n",
      "had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the\n",
      "nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our\n",
      "luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny\n",
      "that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her\n",
      "heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have\n",
      "dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter,\n",
      "and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other's surprise\n",
      "at seeing us already in the dining-room: \"You see, it's Saturday.\" On\n",
      "reaching this point in the story, Françoise would pause to wipe the tears\n",
      "of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would\n",
      "prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom\n",
      "the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to\n",
      "these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long\n",

      "nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the\n",
      "church. It was in these 'Month of Mary' services that I can remember\n",
      "having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not\n",
      "merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a\n",

      "the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one\n",

      "were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves,\n",
      "over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little\n",
      "clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them\n",
      "save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed\n",
      "of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the\n",
      "shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy\n",
      "buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public\n",
      "rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had\n",
      "opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly,\n",
      "like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as\n",

      "some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used\n",

      "reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes,\n",
      "however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must\n",
      "see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously\n",
      "closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Françoise's integrity\n",
      "and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would\n",
      "confide in Françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom\n",
      "the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and,\n",
      "disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be 'as thick as\n",
      "thieves' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two\n",
      "would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie\n",
      "might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which\n",
      "must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her\n",
      "in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was\n",
      "Françoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was\n",
      "perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave\n",
      "her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for\n",
      "herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And\n",
      "so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt,\n",
      "at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being\n",
      "concealed from her by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive\n",
      "movement of Françoise's features, something contradictory in what she was\n",
      "saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would\n",
      "shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise\n",
      "turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in\n",
      "driving into her unhappy servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a\n",
      "disclosure by Eulalie—like one of those discoveries which suddenly open\n",
      "up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has\n",
      "hitherto followed only the beaten paths—proved to my aunt that her own\n",
      "worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. \"But\n",
      "Françoise ought to know that,\" said Eulalie, \"now that you have given her\n",
      "a carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\" gasped my aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in\n",
      "her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I\n",
      "supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter,\n",
      "could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices. My\n",
      "mother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my\n",
      "aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that\n",
      "might be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely\n",
      "scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to\n",
      "ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up\n",
      "her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she\n",
      "would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her\n",
      "face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this\n",
      "way—whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth\n",
      "century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would\n",
      "consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed\n",
      "a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when\n",
      "he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of\n",
      "Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking\n",
      "to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere\n",
      "outward forms—a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no\n",
      "more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible\n",
      "eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter\n",
      "idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought\n",
      "to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning\n",
      "toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their\n",
      "despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in\n",
      "what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and\n",
      "was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good\n",
      "humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with\n",
      "matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did\n",
      "the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier,\n",
      "or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the\n",
      "turning of an avenue, at Versailles.\n",

      "One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé\n",
      "and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole\n",
      "family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole\n",
      "with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to\n",
      "her door at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Léonie,\" she said kindly,\n",
      "\"you have had all your friends here at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And my great-aunt interrupted with: \"Too many good things...\"\n",
      "for, since her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to\n",
      "revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the\n",
      "brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to take advantage,\" he said, \"of the whole family's being\n",
      "here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over\n",
      "again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's bad\n",
      "books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with\n",
      "him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went\n",
      "downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,\n",
      "which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and\n",
      "excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by\n",
      "the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once\n",
      "friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had\n",
      "barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as\n",
      "though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic\n",
      "of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly\n",
      "receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far\n",
      "end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they\n",
      "content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible\n",
      "movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known\n",
      "and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for\n",
      "amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked\n",
      "himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\" he\n",
      "said, \"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is\n",
      "something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties,\n",
      "so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost,\n",
      "which is really attractive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had\n",
      "imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question,\n",
      "had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father's\n",
      "fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned\n",
      "from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on\n",
      "account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came\n",
      "up to us with outstretched hand: \"Do you know, master book-lover,\" he\n",
      "asked me, \"this line of Paul Desjardins?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never\n",
      "read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is\n",
      "converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the\n",
      "most charming water-colour touch—\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even\n",
      "when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all\n",
      "black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself,\n",
      "as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\" He took a cigarette from his\n",
      "pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. \"Goodbye,\n",
      "friends!\" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for\n",
      "dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Françoise, a colonel\n",
      "with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales\n",
      "where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the\n",
      "coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing\n",
      "over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready\n",
      "in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter's craft,\n",
      "which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to\n",
      "jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and\n",
      "included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I\n",
      "would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to\n",
      "inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little\n",
      "green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the\n",
      "asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their\n",
      "heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of\n",
      "imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the\n",
      "soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world.\n",
      "I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite\n",
      "creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the\n",
      "disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern\n",
      "in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue\n",
      "evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when,\n",
      "all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played\n",
      "(lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's\n",

      "\n",
      "Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Françoise with\n",
      "the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her\n",
      "in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the\n",
      "world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the\n",
      "asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately\n",
      "outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers banded about\n",
      "the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And,\n",
      "meanwhile, Françoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens,\n",
      "such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad\n",
      "from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was\n",
      "serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness\n",
      "predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the\n",
      "aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so\n",

      "without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in\n",

      "and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own\n",
      "kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which\n",

      "the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid\n",
      "was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose\n",
      "and awakened Françoise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry\n",
      "was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the\n",
      "house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a\n",

      "innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though\n",
      "conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into\n",
      "surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by\n",
      "the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like\n",

      "speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of\n",

      "a man's deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has\n",
      "previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit's\n",
      "evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our\n",
      "own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and\n",
      "incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not\n",

      "all, I set between them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in\n",
      "miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the\n",
      "distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used\n",

      "only to lengthen, which separate things irremediably from one another,\n",

      "close around it, an 'ornamental water' had been constructed by Swann's\n",
      "parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is the material\n",
      "upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in remaining\n",
      "surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty, and will\n",
      "raise their immemorial standards among all the 'laid-out' scenery of a\n",

      "solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them, springing up out of\n",

      "firmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down\n",
      "out of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the\n",
      "longing and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not\n",
      "actually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting—when I was\n",
      "obliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and\n",
      "were surprised that I had not followed them along the little path,\n",
      "climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already\n",
      "turned. I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of\n",
      "hawthorn-blossom. The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls\n",
      "were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped\n",
      "upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon\n",
      "the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the\n",
      "scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed\n",
      "in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the\n",
      "flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of\n",
      "glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves' in\n",
      "the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed\n",
      "the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the\n",
      "windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like\n",
      "strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with\n",
      "these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be\n",
      "climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the\n",
      "smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and\n",
      "scattered by the first breath of wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in, to\n",
      "marshal! before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose in\n",
      "order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb myself\n",
      "in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the\n",
      "light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain\n",
      "intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same\n",
      "charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it\n",
      "any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred\n",
      "times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned\n",
      "away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with\n",
      "renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge,\n",
      "rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its\n",
      "fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated\n",
      "the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a\n",
      "tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme\n",
      "which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced\n",
      "apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a\n",
      "village, they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the\n",
      "fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender\n",
      "rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy\n",
      "of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a\n",
      "wayfarer's when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and\n",
      "broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy, and cries out,\n",
      "although he has not yet caught sight of it, \"The Sea!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands\n",
      "before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be\n",
      "better able to 'take in' when one has looked away, for a moment, at\n",
      "something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to\n",
      "have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they\n",
      "aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free\n",
      "itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves\n",
      "offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers\n",
      "to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that\n",
      "rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite\n",
      "different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when\n",
      "some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we\n",
      "have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of\n",
      "music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our\n",
      "ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather\n",
      "called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: \"You\n",
      "are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink one; isn't it pretty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and\n",
      "lovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of\n",
      "those days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion,\n",
      "because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular\n",
      "holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for\n",
      "such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially\n",
      "festal—but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the flowers\n",
      "which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no\n",
      "part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of\n",
      "a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them 'in colour,' and consequently\n",

      "sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese\n",
      "when it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed\n",
      "strawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some\n",
      "edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one's costume\n",
      "for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the\n",
      "reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to\n",
      "the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and\n",
      "more natural than any other tints, even after the child's mind has\n",
      "realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not\n",
      "been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had\n",
      "felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was\n",
      "in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the\n",
      "festal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature\n",
      "herself who had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman\n",

      "some procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too\n",
      "ravishing in colour, this rustic 'pompadour.' High up on the branches,\n",
      "like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of\n",

      "which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and\n",
      "blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as\n",
      "different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of\n",
      "dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and\n",
      "ready for the 'Month of Mary,' of which it seemed already to form a part,\n",
      "it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush indeed,\n",
      "and altogether delightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with\n",
      "jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their\n",
      "fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old Spanish\n",
      "leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted green,\n",

      "infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to\n",
      "move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to\n",
      "take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession\n",
      "of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who\n",
      "appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was\n",
      "looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles.\n",
      "Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know, and indeed\n",

      "observation' to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long time\n",
      "afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes\n",
      "would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion\n",
      "was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been quite so\n",
      "black—which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her—I\n",
      "should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined\n",
      "blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger\n",
      "from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out,\n",
      "petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture,\n",
      "bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the\n",

      "She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my\n",
      "grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them\n",
      "was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away with an\n",
      "indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face\n",
      "the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they,\n",
      "continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me,\n",
      "she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my\n",
      "direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have\n",
      "seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to\n",
      "interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good\n",
      "breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same\n",
      "time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was\n",
      "addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little\n",

      "of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that moment,\n",
      "while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen 'ducks,'\n",
      "whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be\n",
      "starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded, and,\n",
      "seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in my\n",
      "direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a\n",

      "its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a\n",
      "moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to\n",
      "me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool\n",
      "as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and\n",
      "irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set\n",
      "apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her\n",

      "and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink\n",
      "hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of\n",
      "their familiarity—so exquisitely painful to myself—with her, and with\n",
      "all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never\n",
      "penetrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: \"Poor\n",

      "she can be left alone with her Charlus—for that was Charlus: I recognised\n",

      "had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being\n",
      "obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior\n",
      "to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in\n",
      "me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up\n",
      "again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring\n",
      "to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her;\n",
      "I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to\n",
      "do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to\n",
      "be so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so\n",

      "you are utterly disgusting!\" However, I walked away, carrying with me,\n",
      "then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of\n",
      "happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws\n",
      "of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little\n",
      "girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held\n",
      "a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and\n",
      "subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name,\n",
      "like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn\n",
      "through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to\n",
      "conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any\n",

      "fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the\n",
      "melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysées, where she lived in Paris.\n",

      "\"Léonie,\" said my grandfather on our return, \"I wish we had had you with\n",

      "the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used\n",
      "to like so much.\" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk,\n",
      "either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope\n",
      "that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors.\n",
      "For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover,\n",
      "Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a\n",
      "time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as,\n",
      "when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still\n",
      "the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send\n",
      "down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she\n",
      "would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my\n",
      "grandfather, \"Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a\n",
      "drive as far as the gate of the park.\" And in saying this she was quite\n",
      "sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the\n",
      "mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which\n",
      "its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine\n",
      "weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her\n",
      "clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired'\n",
      "again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had\n",
      "begun in her—and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of\n",
      "us—was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in\n",
      "preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed\n",
      "wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived\n",
      "for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends\n",
      "bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year,\n",
      "cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see\n",
      "one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate\n",
      "no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that\n",
      "she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house\n",
      "any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with\n",
      "all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to\n",
      "have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced\n",
      "upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she\n",
      "was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement\n",
      "'tiring' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and\n",
      "silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours\n",
      "of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to\n",
      "go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying\n",
      "to make them speak of Mlle. Swann's parents and grandparents, who appeared\n",
      "to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me\n",
      "become almost mythological, of Swann—when I talked with my family I would\n",
      "grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it\n",
      "myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led\n",
      "naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in\n",
      "speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her\n",
      "company; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for\n",
      "instance, to believe that my grandfather's business had been in our family\n",
      "before his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt\n",
      "Léonie wished to visit was on common ground) to correct my statements, to\n",

      "the pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of\n",
      "that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more\n",
      "portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of\n",
      "all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused\n",
      "me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents,\n",
      "for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved\n",
      "them in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them\n",
      "there was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the\n",
      "conversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular\n",
      "seductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found\n",
      "again as soon as it was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that\n",
      "my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must\n",
      "find themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their\n",
      "turn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings,\n",

      "of their hearts.\n",

      "That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather earlier\n",

      "be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my\n",
      "head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my\n",
      "mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on\n",

      "jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in\n",
      "curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my\n",
      "forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my\n",
      "head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at all moved by my\n",
      "tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered\n",
      "headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her. \"Oh, my poor\n",

      "never done me any harm. So I shall always love you.\" And, drying my eyes,\n",
      "I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy the foolish\n",
      "example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring days, instead\n",
      "of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make excursions into\n",

      "at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content myself\n",

      "to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure\n",
      "which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was\n",
      "given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything\n",
      "that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled\n",
      "roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which\n",
      "I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of\n",
      "its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear\n",
      "more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it,\n",

      "filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this\n",

      "the woman's charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that\n",

      "and, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my\n",
      "sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire\n",
      "had no longer any bounds. Moreover—just as in moments of musing\n",

      "and our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the\n",
      "profoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the\n",
      "place in which we may happen to be—the passing figure which my desire\n",
      "evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of 'woman,'\n",
      "but a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time\n",
      "everything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it,\n",
      "seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real\n",
      "existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and\n",
      "its creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl\n",
      "from Méséglise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I\n",
      "had a desire for Balbec and Méséglise. The pleasure which those girls were\n",
      "empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no\n",

      "as I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl\n",
      "from Méséglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which\n",
      "I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found\n",
      "among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about\n",
      "to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination\n",
      "had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville\n",
      "without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know\n",
      "nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl\n",
      "whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me\n",
      "herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose\n",
      "structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the\n",
      "intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe\n",
      "this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would\n",
      "bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind,\n",
      "yielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself) since\n",
      "I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has\n",
      "not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women\n",
      "in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a\n",
      "general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable\n",
      "instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure\n",
      "does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the\n",
      "ultimate object with which one seeks a woman's company, or as the cause of\n",
      "the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does\n",
      "one think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely\n",
      "awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the\n",
      "moment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we\n",
      "find in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it\n",
      "seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for\n",

      "Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville,\n",

      "path which, I believed, might lead me to my death, even—until passion\n",
      "spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant\n",
      "which, creeping in through the window, tumbled all about my body. In vain\n",
      "I called upon it now. In vain I compressed the whole landscape into my\n",

      "upon the trunk of a distant tree, from behind which she must appear and\n",
      "spring towards me; my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before;\n",
      "night was falling; without any hope now would I concentrate my attention,\n",
      "as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal, upon\n",
      "that sterile soil, that stale and outworn land; and it was no longer in\n",
      "lightness of heart, but with sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees\n",
      "of Roussainville wood, from among which no more living creatures made\n",
      "their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched\n",
      "canvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to having\n",
      "to return home without having held in my arms the woman I so greatly\n",
      "desired, I was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards Combray, and to\n",
      "admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller\n",
      "every moment. And if she had appeared, would I have dared to speak to her?\n",

      "being shared by others, or as having any existence apart from myself. They\n",
      "seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory\n",
      "creatures of my temperament. They were in no way connected now with\n",
      "nature, with the world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its\n",

      "forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil's life, his complete absorption,\n",
      "first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and,\n",
      "later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the\n",
      "tortured expression which was never absent from the old man's face in\n",

      "recorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets\n",
      "of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother\n",

      "honest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and\n",
      "crushing misery that had come upon my aunts' old music-master, she was\n",
      "moved to very real grief, and shuddered to think of that other grief, so\n",
      "different in its bitterness, which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling,\n",

      "importunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit\n",
      "down at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been\n",
      "indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again\n",
      "over the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as\n",
      "to indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made\n",
      "her lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which\n",
      "she treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and\n",
      "reticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had\n",
      "characterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where\n",
      "she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding.\n",

      "\"Leave them open,\" said her friend. \"I am hot.\"\n",

      "words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from\n",
      "prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I\n",
      "could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must\n",
      "have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful,\n",
      "when she hastily went on: \"When I say 'see us' I mean, of course, see us\n",
      "reading. It's so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you\n",
      "do some one may be overlooking you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her\n",
      "control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had\n",
      "felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And\n",
      "perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would\n",
      "kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but\n",
      "triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this\n",

      "repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which,\n",

      "from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses\n",
      "clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of\n",
      "her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young\n",
      "woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined,\n",
      "such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her\n",
      "own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a\n",
      "strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to\n",

      "then they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the\n",
      "furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing\n",
      "like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted\n",
      "upon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her\n",
      "friend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on\n",
      "which the old music-master's portrait had been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil\n",
      "realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn\n",

      "To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, \"Oh, please!\"—a gentle reproach which\n",

      "by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion (for\n",
      "that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long\n",
      "course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments), but\n",
      "rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of\n",
      "egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was\n",
      "attempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the\n",
      "smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies,\n",
      "that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and\n",
      "generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that\n",
      "criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt. But\n",
      "she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a\n",
      "woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless\n",
      "dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow\n",
      "to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother,\n",
      "feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the\n",
      "last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they\n",
      "were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her\n",
      "friend took the girl's head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow\n",
      "with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil,\n",
      "as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull\n",
      "and melancholy life of an orphan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?\" she said,\n",
      "taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil's ear something\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! You would never dare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not dare to spit on it? On that?\" shouted the friend with deliberate\n",

      "I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward,\n",
      "preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the\n",

      "account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.\n",
      "\n",

      "continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he\n",
      "might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that\n",
      "in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so strong and\n",
      "so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such\n",
      "completeness save in what is nowadays called a 'sadist'; it is behind the\n",
      "footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual\n",
      "country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to\n",
      "spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and\n",
      "no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for\n",
      "melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic' instinct that is\n",
      "responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least\n",
      "inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous\n",
      "cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes\n",
      "of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate\n",
      "expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety;\n",
      "the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to\n",
      "other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to\n",
      "herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle.\n",
      "Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was\n",
      "probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil, which a\n",
      "wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not\n",
      "have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would\n",
      "not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue,\n",
      "respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have\n",
      "practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in\n",
      "their profanation. 'Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are creatures so\n",
      "purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure\n",
      "appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And\n",
      "when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to\n",
      "impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for\n",
      "themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary\n",
      "illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and\n",
      "scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could\n",
      "understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised\n",
      "that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished\n",
      "to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once\n",
      "suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor\n",
      "old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really\n",
      "desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what\n",
      "remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment\n",
      "of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother's blue eyes\n",
      "which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the\n",
      "family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up\n",
      "between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a\n",
      "mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any\n",
      "way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to\n",
      "which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the\n",
      "idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather,\n",
      "that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure\n",
      "came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in\n",
      "her virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something\n",
      "diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at\n",

      "vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure\n",
      "of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all\n",
      "feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to\n",
      "those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed\n",
      "not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and\n",
      "cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that\n",
      "she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an\n",
      "accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that\n",
      "savage antipathy towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have\n",
      "thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one\n",
      "which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in\n",
      "herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the\n",

      "not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but,\n",
      "broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous\n",

      "nothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young woman,\n",
      "whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin,\n",
      "and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, 'to bury herself,'\n",
      "to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name, and still more the\n",

      "capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of an unfamiliar\n",

      "the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its overshadowing trees,\n",
      "and an endless series of hot summer afternoons. And I knew that they bore\n",
      "not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the\n",
      "fourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords\n",
      "in battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of\n",

      "rose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain\n",
      "some precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my\n",
      "eyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much to\n",
      "see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite\n",
      "authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its imagined soil\n",
      "intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that Guermantes, changing\n",

      "of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be\n",
      "seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream that Mme. de Guermantes,\n",
      "taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself, invited me there, that all\n",
      "day long she stood fishing for trout by my side. And when evening came,\n",
      "holding my hand in her own, as we passed by the little gardens of her\n",
      "vassals, she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and\n",
      "purple spikes along the tops of the low walls, and would teach me all\n",
      "their names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I\n",
      "meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished, some\n",
      "day, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I\n",
      "was going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried\n",
      "to discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical\n",
      "significance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would\n",
      "see before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid\n",
      "of talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its\n",
      "development. Sometimes I would depend upon my father's arranging\n",
      "everything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who\n",
      "'really counted,' that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which\n",
      "Françoise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of\n",
      "life and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the\n",
      "compulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the\n",
      "houses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the\n",
      "Minister for Mme. Sazerat's son, who had been ordered to some\n",
      "watering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time,\n",
      "among the candidates whose surnames began with 'A,' instead of having to\n",
      "wait his turn as an 'S.' If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been\n",
      "captured by brigands, convinced that my father's understanding with the\n",
      "supreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the\n",
      "Almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out\n",
      "anything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually\n",
      "threatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the\n",
      "inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance\n",
      "from bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this\n",
      "black cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of\n",
      "my future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial\n",
      "illusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father,\n",
      "who would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be\n",
      "the first writer of my day. But at other times, while my parents were\n",
      "growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my\n",
      "actual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and\n",
      "one which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be\n",
      "comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit,\n",
      "from whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was\n",
      "bound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further\n",
      "possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in\n",
      "the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die\n",
      "like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of\n",
      "those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I\n",
      "renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been\n",
      "given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the\n",
      "nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches\n",
      "that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in\n",

      "be able to see her in church.\" It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened,\n",
      "that I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us\n",
      "the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the\n",

      "Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side,\n",
      "enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large\n",
      "nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new\n",
      "and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on\n",
      "the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm,\n",
      "I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled\n",
      "the portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the\n",
      "particular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to\n",
      "catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:—_a\n",
      "large nose, blue eyes_, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my\n",
      "presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: \"This lady is like\n",
      "the Duchesse de Guermantes.\" Now the chapel from which she was following\n",
      "the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones,\n",
      "yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of\n",
      "the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this\n",
      "chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members\n",
      "came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman\n",
      "resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very\n",
      "day on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that\n",
      "chapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not\n",
      "having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was\n",
      "picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window,\n",
      "as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest\n",
      "of the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a\n",
      "red face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her\n",
      "cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the\n",
      "suspicion brushed against my mind (though it was immediately banished)\n",
      "that this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical\n",
      "composition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but\n",
      "that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged\n",
      "to a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors\n",
      "and tradesmen. \"It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!\"\n",
      "were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with\n",
      "which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no\n",
      "resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de\n",
      "Guermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like\n",
      "the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for\n",
      "the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not\n",
      "of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that\n",
      "allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but\n",
      "which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the\n",
      "corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of\n",
      "life, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a\n",

      "Guermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: \"It is Mme. de\n",
      "Guermantes\"; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and\n",
      "the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes, with a\n",
      "space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed,\n",
      "now that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself,\n",
      "acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed\n",
      "for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it\n",
      "had expected, began to react and to say within me: \"Great and glorious\n",

      "rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a\n",
      "ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at\n",
      "the moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it\n",
      "fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there\n",
      "motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or\n",
      "awkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are\n",

      "determination, that form of the instinct of self-preservation with which\n",
      "we guard everything that is best in ourselves, not to admit that I had\n",
      "been in any way deceived—I found only beauty there; setting her once\n",

      "humanity with which the sight, pure and simple, of her in the flesh had\n",

      "reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I\n",

      "think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want\n",
      "of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those\n",
      "literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything,\n",
      "suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of\n",
      "a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each\n",
      "of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath\n",
      "what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and\n",
      "seize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to\n",
      "discover. As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I\n",
      "would stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing,\n",

      "stone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to\n",
      "be teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which\n",

      "lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of\n",
      "them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual\n",
      "value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an\n",
      "unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in\n",
      "that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence\n",
      "which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great\n",
      "literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these\n",
      "impressions of form or perfume or colour—to strive for a perception of\n",
      "what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse\n",
      "which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself\n",
      "the fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents\n",
      "called me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment\n",
      "necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be\n",
      "better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to\n",
      "exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose. And so I concerned myself no\n",
      "longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at\n",
      "ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its\n",
      "visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive,\n",
      "like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I\n",
      "used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept\n",
      "them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of\n",
      "something else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with\n",
      "the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that\n",
      "people had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight\n",
      "was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a\n",
      "confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago\n",
      "the reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had\n",
      "the energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had\n",
      "prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very\n",
      "glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr.\n",
      "Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and\n",
      "recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an\n",

      "Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us\n",
      "to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that\n",
      "special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught\n",
      "sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was\n",
      "playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road\n",
      "seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a\n",
      "third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a\n",
      "hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance,\n",
      "appeared none the less to be standing by their side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of\n",
      "aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not\n",
      "penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay\n",
      "behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once\n",
      "to contain and to conceal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so\n",
      "little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we\n",
      "drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for\n",
      "the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the\n",
      "business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome;\n",
      "I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines,\n",
      "moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more.\n",
      "And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have\n",
      "vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and\n",
      "sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense\n",
      "of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more\n",
      "fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting\n",
      "for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again\n",
      "to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of\n",
      "which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road.\n",
      "The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely\n",
      "acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to\n",
      "fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my\n",

      "and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled\n",
      "me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I\n",
      "could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had\n",

      "three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds\n",
      "perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then\n",
      "the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the\n",
      "steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting\n",

      "to say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then\n",
      "entered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been\n",
      "bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of\n",
      "pink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of\n",

      "gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in\n",
      "matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how\n",
      "to decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to\n",
      "shine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the\n",

      "social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people\n",
      "whose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at\n",
      "inferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when\n",

      "beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose\n",
      "beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for the physical qualities which\n",
      "attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite\n",
      "of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his\n",
      "favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a\n",

      "a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company\n",
      "by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him,\n",

      "to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his\n",
      "fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with\n",
      "them. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to\n",
      "some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it\n",
      "might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up\n",

      "whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might\n",
      "barter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he\n",
      "would laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by\n",
      "many rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to\n",
      "that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who\n",
      "seek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness\n",

      "indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every\n",

      "part of the town, which must be so depressing, and was \"not nearly smart\n",
      "enough for such a very smart man.\" And when he allowed her to come she had\n",
      "said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time\n",
      "in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last,\n",
      "speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest\n",
      "of the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a\n",
      "kind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life,\n",
      "tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a\n",

      "without expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no\n",
      "longer, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity,\n",
      "tends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it\n",
      "may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his\n",
      "younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he\n",
      "loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be\n",
      "enough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would\n",
      "appear—since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective\n",
      "pleasure—that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in\n",
      "its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical\n",

      "already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer\n",

      "youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her\n",

      "of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised\n",
      "in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for\n",
      "her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its\n",

      "being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting\n",
      "forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a\n",
      "sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts,\n",
      "gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different\n",

      "vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere\n",
      "attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the\n",

      "might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then,\n",
      "fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply\n",
      "to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And\n",
      "so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the\n",
      "offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would\n",

      "perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the\n",
      "question that he never dared to ask: \"Do you really mean that?\" He was no\n",
      "more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the\n",
      "street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he\n",

      "impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the\n",

      "Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday\n",
      "existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he\n",
      "accepts everything that we say as gospel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never dared to mention it,\" M. Verdurin had answered, \"but I've noticed\n",

      "sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending\n",
      "that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for\n",
      "three hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost\n",
      "impossible to match.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that\n",
      "evening; \"Swann!\" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by\n",
      "his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly\n",
      "unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for\n",
      "anything. And seeing that no one answered him, \"Swann! Who on earth is\n",
      "Swann?\" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme.\n",
      "Verdurin had explained, \"Why, Odette's friend, whom she told us about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" answered the Doctor, at once\n",
      "mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's\n",
      "appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with\n",
      "Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. \"Nothing\n",
      "amuses me more than match-making,\" he confided to Cottard; \"I have been\n",
      "tremendously successful, even with women!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had\n",
      "alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived,\n",
      "however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which,\n",
      "though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He\n",
      "had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in\n",
      "the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who\n",
      "have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it\n",
      "transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the\n",
      "imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed\n",
      "from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly,\n",
      "grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a\n",
      "trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the\n",
      "movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of\n",
      "his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world\n",
      "when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being\n",
      "introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to\n",
      "whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being\n",
      "conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social deportment, so that in the\n",
      "company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and\n",
      "their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures\n",
      "with which, by their account, any of their 'bores' would have dispensed.\n",
      "He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing\n",
      "him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to\n",
      "one another (a grimace which Cottard styled \"letting 'em all come\"), Swann\n",
      "supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already\n",
      "somewhere, probably in some house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself\n",
      "very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the\n",
      "mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste,\n",
      "especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter\n",
      "for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that\n",
      "the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a\n",
      "husband would not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any\n",
      "allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the\n",
      "Doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The\n",
      "painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann\n",
      "found him very pleasant. \"Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I\n",
      "have been,\" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour,\n",
      "\"perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait\" (for which she had\n",
      "given the painter a commission). \"Take care, Master Biche,\" she reminded\n",
      "the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as\n",
      "'Master,' \"to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle.\n",
      "You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's what I've\n",
      "asked you to paint—the portrait of his smile.\" And since the phrase\n",
      "struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure\n",
      "that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use\n",
      "of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it\n",
      "again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of\n",
      "the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature\n",
      "had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in\n",
      "palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he\n",
      "belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was\n",
      "delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect\n",
      "in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age\n",
      "of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the consonants which\n",
      "he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his\n",
      "gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette,\n",
      "Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in\n",
      "fact, with emphasis on the distinction: \"M. Swann, pray let me present to\n",
      "you our friend Saniette\") but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of\n",
      "gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since\n",
      "Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him\n",
      "with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by\n",
      "Swann's next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the\n",
      "pianist's aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for\n",
      "she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing\n",
      "could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it\n",
      "always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference,\n",
      "but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely\n",
      "uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and\n",
      "pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling\n",
      "manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in\n",
      "the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had\n",
      "actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of\n",
      "continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare\n",
      "intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann\n",
      "supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation\n",
      "with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is such an excellent woman!\" he rejoined. \"I grant you that she is\n",
      "not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly\n",
      "when you are alone with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure she can,\" Swann hastened to conciliate him. \"All I meant was\n",
      "that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'\" he went on, isolating the\n",
      "epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, \"and, after all, that is\n",
      "something of a compliment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a moment,\" said M. Verdurin, \"now, this will surprise you; she\n",
      "writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is\n",
      "admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M.\n",
      "Swann?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should count myself most fortunate...\" Swann was beginning, a trifle\n",
      "pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said,\n",
      "and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the\n",
      "use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn\n",
      "word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by\n",
      "Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately\n",
      "pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what\n",
      "he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in\n",
      "current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing\n",
      "was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation,\n",
      "which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at\n",
      "that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most fortunate for France!\" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms\n",
      "with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign of\n",
      "brooding melancholy down in your corner,\" shouted Mme. Verdurin. \"You\n",
      "don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the\n",
      "stool of repentance,\" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood,\n",
      "which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in\n",
      "her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,' and\n",
      "'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she\n",
      "had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which\n",
      "her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that\n",
      "the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to\n",
      "the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers\n",
      "and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never\n",
      "successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of\n",
      "foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant\n",
      "repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible\n",
      "objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation\n",
      "of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the\n",
      "accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real\n",
      "hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which\n",
      "signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she\n",
      "was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the\n",
      "circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was\n",
      "now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'—and to the utter despair of M.\n",
      "Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his\n",
      "wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath\n",
      "in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a\n",
      "feigned but continuous hilarity—she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight\n",
      "her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a\n",
      "cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some\n",
      "indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands,\n",
      "which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at\n",
      "all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh\n",
      "which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate.\n",
      "So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship,\n",
      "scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a\n",
      "cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft\n",
      "and sob with fellow-feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light his\n",
      "pipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!\"), went and\n",
      "begged the young musician to sit down at the piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be tormented,\"\n",
      "cried Mme. Verdurin. \"I won't have him tormented.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why on earth should it bother him?\" rejoined M. Verdurin. \"I'm sure\n",
      "M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is\n",
      "going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no, not my sonata!\" she screamed, \"I don't want to be made to cry\n",
      "until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last\n",
      "time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance; you are\n",
      "all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will\n",
      "have to stay in bed, for a week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat\n",
      "down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them\n",
      "were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive\n",
      "originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the acute\n",
      "sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would attract the\n",
      "attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end\n",
      "of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as in Parliamentary\n",
      "debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next\n",
      "day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming\n",
      "that evening, and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been\n",
      "so amusingly done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, all right, then,\" said M. Verdurin, \"he can play just the _andante_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just the _andante_! How you do go on,\" cried his wife. \"As if it weren't\n",
      "'just the _andante_' that breaks every bone in my body. The 'Master' is\n",
      "really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he said 'we need\n",
      "only have the _finale_,' or 'just the overture' of the _Meistersinger_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not\n",
      "because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the\n",
      "distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the\n",
      "existence of certain neurasthenic states—but from his habit, common to\n",
      "many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as\n",
      "soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important,\n",
      "the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which\n",
      "the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache\n",
      "formed an essential factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't be ill this time, you'll find,\" he told her, seeking at the\n",
      "same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. \"And, if you\n",
      "are ill, we will cure you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you, really?\" Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour\n",
      "in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps,\n",
      "too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked\n",
      "herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all\n",
      "only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an\n",
      "invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow\n",
      "weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own\n",
      "prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are\n",
      "free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always\n",
      "ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands\n",
      "of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least\n",
      "inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a\n",
      "tabloid, set them once again upon their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying\n",
      "to Mme. Verdurin, \"I have my own little corner, haven't I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up.\n",
      "\"You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can\n",
      "make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What charming Beauvais!\" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before\n",
      "he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you appreciate my sofa,\" replied Mme. Verdurin, \"and I warn you\n",
      "that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the\n",
      "idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs,\n",
      "too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems\n",
      "in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry\n",
      "on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you\n",
      "look at them;—I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just\n",
      "look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on\n",
      "a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well\n",
      "drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design!\n",
      "Doesn't it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I\n",
      "am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of\n",
      "it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth\n",
      "with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing\n",
      "at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me\n",
      "like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my\n",
      "own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without\n",
      "feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite\n",
      "surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,\" said\n",
      "the painter, \"we shan't get any music to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,\" she went on, \"are forbidden\n",
      "pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as\n",
      "soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly\n",
      "jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don't say that you never\n",
      "have been jealous!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call\n",
      "you as a witness; did I utter a word?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not\n",
      "like to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be\n",
      "caressed, caressed in the ear; you'll like that, I think. Here's the young\n",
      "gentleman who will take charge of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him\n",
      "than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:\n",
      "\n",
      "The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played\n",
      "on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material\n",
      "quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a\n",
      "source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part,\n",
      "delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly\n",
      "perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of\n",
      "sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and\n",
      "breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea,\n",
      "silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given\n",
      "moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a\n",
      "name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to\n",
      "collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony—he knew not\n",
      "which—that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul,\n",
      "just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of\n",
      "evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to\n",
      "his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an\n",
      "impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely\n",
      "musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and\n",
      "irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in\n",
      "an instant, is, so to speak, an impression _sine materia_. Presumably the\n",
      "notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes,\n",
      "over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to\n",
      "trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breath or tenuity,\n",
      "stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these\n",
      "sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those\n",
      "which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to\n",
      "awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in\n",
      "its molten liquidity the _motifs_ which now and then emerge, barely\n",
      "discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by\n",
      "the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe,\n",
      "to recollect, to name; ineffable;—if our memory, like a labourer who\n",
      "toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the\n",
      "waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases,\n",
      "enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so,\n",
      "hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died\n",
      "away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript,\n",
      "summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his\n",
      "eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same\n",
      "impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able\n",
      "to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its\n",
      "notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite\n",
      "object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture,\n",
      "thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he\n",
      "had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments\n",
      "from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to\n",
      "partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he\n",
      "had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could\n",
      "initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and\n",
      "strange desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere,\n",
      "towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated.\n",
      "And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was\n",
      "prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its\n",
      "direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy,\n",
      "incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys\n",
      "unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he\n",
      "might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without\n",
      "speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less\n",
      "profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a\n",
      "man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has\n",
      "brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power\n",
      "of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her\n",
      "again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even\n",
      "her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months,\n",
      "to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation.\n",
      "He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any\n",
      "ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral\n",
      "satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally\n",
      "stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in\n",
      "that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his\n",
      "mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in\n",
      "(although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown\n",
      "also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which\n",
      "allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as\n",
      "he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better\n",
      "by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an\n",
      "invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did\n",
      "not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in\n",
      "his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal\n",
      "opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which\n",
      "had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much\n",
      "he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish,\n",
      "the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works.\n",
      "Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter\n",
      "a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but\n",
      "then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not\n",
      "altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a\n",
      "confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings,\n",
      "or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change\n",
      "in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered\n",
      "from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto\n",
      "beyond all hope, of starting to lead—and better late than never—a wholly\n",
      "different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that\n",
      "he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over\n",
      "to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among\n",
      "them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had\n",
      "ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the\n",
      "moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative\n",
      "influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the\n",
      "power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose\n",
      "work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to\n",
      "procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the\n",
      "course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had\n",
      "been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had\n",
      "either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed\n",
      "been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who\n",
      "had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his\n",
      "hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians\n",
      "whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play;\n",
      "but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing\n",
      "further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as\n",
      "he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little\n",
      "phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that\n",
      "it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them\n",
      "the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun to\n",
      "play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars,\n",
      "Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance,\n",
      "which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to\n",
      "veil the mystery of its birth—and recognised, secret, whispering,\n",
      "articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so\n",
      "peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could\n",
      "have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend's\n",
      "drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street,\n",
      "and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew\n",
      "and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents\n",
      "of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a reflection of its smile.\n",
      "But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told\n",
      "that it was the _andante_ movement of Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and\n",
      "violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as\n",

      "little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for\n",
      "infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a\n",
      "fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a\n",
      "painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative\n",
      "poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed\n",
      "those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the\n",
      "transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of\n",
      "roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the\n",
      "material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details—the charming\n",
      "prodigality of the chemist—details which would have been eliminated from\n",
      "an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished\n",
      "to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that\n",
      "these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming\n",
      "from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they\n",
      "were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And\n",
      "as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in\n",
      "these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time;\n",
      "but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms\n",
      "among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden\n",
      "roses—marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of\n",
      "a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which\n",
      "had and those which had not been 'in bloom'—shewed me that these were\n",
      "petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package had\n",
      "embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their\n",
      "colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which\n",
      "was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower.\n",
      "Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she\n",
      "would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of\n",
      "which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood,\n",

      "needed for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to\n",
      "keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her\n",
      "bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and\n",
      "would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life,\n",
      "like a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray,\n",
      "which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Françoise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me\n",
      "away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad\n",
      "brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet\n",
      "have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the\n",
      "points of a crown of thorns-er the beads of a rosary, and she would say to\n",
      "me: \"Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and\n",
      "if you see Françoise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing\n",
      "herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything.\"\n",

      "Françoise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not at\n",
      "that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours,\n",
      "was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent\n",
      "in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to\n",
      "Combray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in Paris\n",
      "with her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on New Year's\n",
      "Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put a five-franc\n",
      "piece in my hand and said: \"Now, be careful. Don't make any mistake. Wait\n",
      "until you hear me say 'Good morning, Françoise,' and I touch your arm\n",
      "before you give it to her.\" No sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark\n",
      "hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff\n",
      "and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of\n",
      "a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect,\n",
      "framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in\n",
      "its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we\n",
      "could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity,\n",
      "blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the\n",
      "most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward.\n",
      "Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: \"Good morning,\n",
      "Françoise.\" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin,\n",
      "which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we\n",
      "had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise.\n",
      "We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed\n",
      "the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener\n",
      "relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family'\n",
      "(for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites\n",
      "the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh\n",
      "charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would\n",
      "she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so\n",
      "bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was\n",
      "often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her\n",
      "nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to\n",
      "make of him, and whether he took after his granny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Françoise\n",
      "was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would\n",
      "speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and\n",
      "their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had guessed that Françoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and\n",
      "that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the\n",
      "two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when\n",
      "Françoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to\n",
      "her, with a smile: \"Tell me, Françoise, if Julien has had to go away, and\n",
      "you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will\n",
      "make the best of it, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Françoise answered, laughing: \"Madame knows everything; Madame is\n",

      "difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman's,\n",
      "daring to employ a scientific term) \"they brought here for Mme. Octave,\n",
      "which see what is in your heart\"—and she went off, disturbed that anyone\n",

      "the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills\n",
      "seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did\n",
      "everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well\n",
      "or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the\n",
      "only one of my aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black\n",
      "coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants\n",
      "who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger,\n",
      "doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew\n",
      "him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of\n",
      "him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will\n",
      "be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to\n",
      "those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real\n",
      "capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that\n",
      "slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often\n",
      "conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can\n",
      "produce the least trace of individuality.\n",

      "When Françoise, having seen that my parents had everything they required,\n",

      "In this way Françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them,\n",
      "in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the\n",

      "an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! not before midday!\" my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation,\n",
      "darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it\n",
      "be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen\n",
      "satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to\n",
      "luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still\n",
      "before enjoying the spectacle. \"And it will come in the middle of my\n",
      "luncheon!\" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a\n",
      "distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same\n",
      "time.\"At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of\n",
      "the flat plates?\" These were the only plates which had pictures on them\n",
      "and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description\n",
      "on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her\n",
      "spectacles and spell out: \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\" \"Aladdin, or\n",
      "the Wonderful Lamp,\" and smile, and say \"Very good indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I may as well go across to Camus...\" Françoise would hazard, seeing that\n",
      "my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.\n",

      "\"No, no; it's not worth while now; it's certain to be the Pupin girl. My\n",

      "\n",
      "But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for\n",
      "Françoise, since at Combray a person whom one 'didn't know at all' was as\n",
      "incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be\n",
      "forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue\n",
      "du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena,\n",
      "careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous\n",
      "monster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know,' either\n",
      "personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or\n",
      "less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be\n",
      "Mme. Sauton's son discharged from the army, or the Abbé Perdreau's niece\n",

      "Châteaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray\n",
      "for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the\n",
      "thought that there might be in Combray people whom you 'didn't know at\n",
      "all,' simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at\n",
      "once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Curé had given warning\n",
      "that they expected their 'strangers.' In the evening, when I came in and\n",
      "went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash\n",
      "enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom\n",
      "my grandfather didn't know:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man grandfather didn't know at all!\" she would exclaim. \"That's a\n",
      "likely story.\" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news,\n",
      "she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would\n",
      "be summoned. \"Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux,\n",
      "uncle? A man you didn't know at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, of course I did,\" my grandfather would answer; \"it was Prosper, Mme.\n",
      "Bouillebœuf's gardener's brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, well!\" my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; \"and\n",
      "the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn't know at all!\" After\n",
      "which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to\n",
      "upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in\n",
      "Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a\n",
      "dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it\n",
      "incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all\n",
      "her inductive talent and her leisure hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will be Mme. Sazerat's dog,\" Françoise would suggest, without any\n",

      "'split her head.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As if I didn't know Mme. Sazerat's dog!\"—for my aunt's critical mind\n",

      "left you; I can't afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it's nearly\n",
      "ten o'clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I've still to dress the\n",

      "still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black,\n",
      "and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply\n",
      "furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led\n",
      "us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women\n",
      "going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had\n",
      "managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress\n",

      "softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow\n",
      "beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave,\n",
      "washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets\n",
      "of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting\n",

      "fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together\n",
      "two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately\n",
      "scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun\n",
      "scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of\n",

      "Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the\n",
      "blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass,\n",
      "penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or\n",

      "correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds\n",
      "wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate\n",

      "at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two\n",

      "taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman\n",
      "of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent\n",

      "Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter\n",
      "at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad. Françoise\n",
      "was at once dispatched to the grocer's, but returned empty-handed owing to\n",
      "the absence of Théodore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in\n",
      "the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer's assistant gave him not only\n",
      "relations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of\n",
      "their affairs.\n",

      "\"Ah!\" my aunt would sigh, \"I wish it were time for Eulalie to come. She\n",

      "Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had 'retired' after\n",
      "the death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service\n",
      "from her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from\n",
      "which she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or,\n",
      "when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Théodore\n",
      "a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my\n",
      "aunt Léonie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass\n",
      "or vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little\n",
      "income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going\n",
      "from time to time to look after the Curé's linen, or that of some other\n",
      "person of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black\n",
      "cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to\n",
      "some Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks\n",
      "and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the\n",
      "one great distraction in the life of my aunt Léonie, who now saw hardly\n",
      "anyone else, except the reverend Curé. My aunt had by degrees erased every\n",
      "other visitor's name from her list, because they all committed the fatal\n",
      "error, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of\n",
      "people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of\n",
      "which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to\n",
      "take so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and\n",
      "with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or\n",
      "doubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a\n",
      "good red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful\n",
      "sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her\n",
      "medicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people\n",
      "who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought,\n",
      "in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those\n",
      "whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable\n",
      "hesitation and at Franchise's urgent request, and who in the course of\n",
      "their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been\n",
      "done them by venturing a timid: \"Don't you think that if you were just to\n",
      "stir out a little on really fine days...?\" or who, on the other hand, when\n",
      "she said to them: \"I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear\n",
      "friends!\" had replied: \"Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you\n",

      "would never open to them again. And if Françoise was amused by the look of\n",
      "consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of\n",
      "these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming\n",
      "to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more\n",
      "heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never failed)\n",
      "for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had\n",
      "to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret\n",
      "admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these\n",
      "other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In\n",
      "short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to\n",
      "see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her\n",
      "sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a\n",
      "minute: \"The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!\", twenty times Eulalie\n",
      "would retort with: \"Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will\n",
      "live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.\" For one\n",
      "of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of\n",
      "corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to\n",
      "eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme. Sazerin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not ask to live to a hundred,\" my aunt would say, for she preferred\n",
      "to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to\n",
      "distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place\n",
      "regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent\n",
      "them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those\n",
      "days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at\n",
      "once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie\n",
      "were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of\n",
      "waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from\n",
      "looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms\n",
      "in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end\n",
      "of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her\n",
      "ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than\n",
      "this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Françoise would\n",
      "become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go\n",
      "upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But—and this more than ever from the day on\n",
      "which fine weather definitely set in at Combray—the proud hour °f noon,\n",
      "descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a\n",
      "moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have\n",
      "echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in,\n",
      "after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in\n",
      "front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day,\n",
      "and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of\n",
      "eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the\n",
      "table she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add—as the labour of\n",
      "fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets,\n",
      "the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so\n",
      "effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved\n",
      "on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some\n",
      "extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life—a brill,\n",
      "because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she\n",
      "had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with\n",
      "marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast\n",
      "leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be\n",
      "plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner;\n",
      "spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to\n",
      "get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left;\n",
      "raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to\n",
      "come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years;\n",
      "a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond\n",
      "cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf,\n",
      "because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all these had\n",
      "been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more\n",
      "particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of\n",
      "chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Françoise, would\n",
      "be laid before us, light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music,\n",
      "into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to\n",
      "partake of it, saying: \"No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\"\n",
      "would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when\n",
      "an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and\n",
      "material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his\n",
      "signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have\n",
      "shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the\n",
      "'piece' was still being played, and under the composer's-very eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length my mother would say to me: \"Now, don't stay here all day; you\n",

      "And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented\n",
      "here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon\n",
      "a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender,\n",
      "allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a\n",
      "lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a\n",
      "service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil\n",
      "rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a\n",
      "separate building, my aunt's back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled\n",
      "floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the cave of\n",

      "offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes\n",

      "In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which\n",

      "grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a\n",
      "major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its\n",
      "opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which\n",
      "seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet\n",
      "fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of\n",
      "existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a\n",
      "disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle\n",
      "Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel\n",
      "which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the\n",
      "following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be\n",
      "sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a\n",
      "plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of\n",
      "striped linen, purple and white. He would complain that I had not been to\n",
      "see him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a\n",
      "marchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever\n",
      "sat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded\n",
      "mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its\n",
      "furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents', only yellow; then\n",
      "we would enter what he called his 'study,' a room whose walls were hung\n",
      "with prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy\n",
      "goddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her\n",
      "brow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there\n",
      "was thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were\n",
      "then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect\n",
      "again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they\n",
      "may advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I\n",
      "would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the\n",
      "coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle\n",
      "would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood\n",
      "there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and\n",
      "waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a\n",
      "supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words:\n",
      "\"A quarter past two,\" which the servant would echo with amazement, but\n",
      "without disputing them: \"A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go\n",

      "capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the\n",

      "numberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its\n",
      "enjoyment. Between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and\n",
      "another's, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an\n",

      "had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy\n",
      "and invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal\n",

      "all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for,\n",
      "like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or\n",

      "awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he\n",

      "with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression\n",
      "upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my\n",
      "gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours\n",

      "account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In\n",
      "doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How\n",
      "could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could\n",
      "not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I\n",

      "prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this\n",
      "woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for\n",
      "ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people\n",

      "reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the\n",
      "least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of\n",
      "the acquaintance I had made at my uncle's I should at the same time\n",
      "transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the\n",
      "introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely\n",
      "different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to\n",
      "form their estimate of my uncle's conduct. My father and grandfather had\n",
      "'words' with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days\n",
      "later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage,\n",
      "Î felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should\n",
      "have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I\n",
      "considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and\n",
      "petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew\n",
      "him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from\n",
      "so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that,\n",
      "in doing so I was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and\n",
      "though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes\n",
      "on him again.\n",

      "water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,\" I would then decide to go\n",
      "indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The\n",
      "kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which\n",
      "an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity\n",
      "and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in\n",
      "which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl\n",
      "there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of\n",
      "asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor\n",
      "sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray\n",
      "for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Françoise allowed her to run\n",
      "so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she\n",
      "was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious\n",
      "casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be\n",
      "detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the\n",
      "cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his\n",
      "paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who\n",
      "pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid\n",
      "he would say: \"Well, how goes it with Giotto's Charity?\" And indeed the\n",
      "poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her,\n",
      "even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did\n",
      "distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons\n",
      "rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can\n",
      "see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another\n",
      "respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by\n",
      "the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to\n",
      "understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression\n",
      "of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an\n",
      "ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion\n",
      "of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed\n",
      "in the Arena beneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose\n",
      "portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that\n",
      "virtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have\n",
      "found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the\n",
      "painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her\n",
      "feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to\n",
      "extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of\n",
      "sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to\n",
      "God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up\n",
      "a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one\n",

      "'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in\n",
      "this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented\n",
      "with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so\n",
      "huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of\n",
      "her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who is filling a\n",
      "balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter,\n",
      "when we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on\n",
      "the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious\n",
      "thoughts.\n",

      "Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures\n",

      "whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in\n",
      "later years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special\n",

      "its symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols (for\n",

      "actually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more\n",

      "allegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack) of\n",
      "participation by a person's soul in the significant marks of its own\n",
      "special virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if\n",

      "These were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is\n",
      "true that the people concerned in them were not what Françoise would have\n",
      "called 'real people.' But none of the feelings which the joys or\n",
      "misfortunes of a 'real' person awaken in us can be awakened except through\n",
      "a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the\n",
      "first novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one\n",
      "essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that\n",
      "simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple,\n",
      "of 'real' people would be a decided improvement. A 'real' person,\n",
      "profoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure\n",
      "perceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque,\n",
      "offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to\n",
      "lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of\n",
      "the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any\n",
      "emotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he\n",
      "has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The\n",
      "novelist's happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque\n",
      "sections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial\n",
      "sections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself.\n",
      "After which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new\n",
      "order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made\n",
      "them our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they\n",
      "are holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the\n",
      "book, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has\n",
      "brought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every\n",
      "emotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as\n",
      "might a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression\n",
      "than those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour\n",
      "he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of\n",
      "which, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting\n",
      "to know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been\n",
      "revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our\n",
      "perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is\n",
      "our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by\n",
      "imagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural\n",
      "phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish,\n",
      "successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual\n",
      "sensation of change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human\n",
      "element, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of\n",
      "the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made\n",
      "a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape\n",
      "which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for\n",
      "two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Combray garden,\n",
      "sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of\n",
      "mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills,\n",
      "where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds\n",
      "of watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple\n",
      "flowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream\n",
      "of a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two\n",
      "summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running\n",
      "water; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind,\n",
      "purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like\n",
      "complementary colours.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever\n",
      "distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not\n",
      "its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the\n",
      "scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly\n",
      "portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my\n",
      "eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the\n",
      "author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind\n",
      "would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting\n",
      "a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression—one which I\n",
      "hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and\n",
      "never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly\n",
      "conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised—of\n",
      "their being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and\n",
      "explored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the\n",
      "country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous\n",
      "advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the\n",
      "sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still\n",
      "it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be\n",
      "borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break\n",
      "out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly,\n",
      "all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the\n",
      "resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things,\n",
      "endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves\n",
      "have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in\n",
      "themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds,\n",
      "to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our\n",
      "spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate\n",
      "other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside\n",
      "ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the\n",
      "woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the\n",
      "time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to\n",
      "them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the\n",
      "mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my\n",
      "dreams of travel and of love were only moments—which I isolate\n",
      "artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different\n",
      "heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or\n",
      "motion—were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of\n",
      "all the forces of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions\n",
      "from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I\n",
      "come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures\n",
      "of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good\n",
      "scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour\n",
      "chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already\n",
      "spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke\n",
      "which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that\n",
      "followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that\n",
      "long part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner\n",
      "which Françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and\n",
      "refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my\n",
      "book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds\n",
      "only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself,\n",
      "close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface, and I would be unable to\n",
      "believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue\n",
      "which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would\n",
      "even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than\n",
      "the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike;\n",
      "something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the\n",
      "fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had\n",
      "stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden\n",
      "bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday\n",
      "afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I\n",
      "was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life,\n",
      "replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land\n",
      "watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions\n",
      "to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue\n",
      "of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on\n",
      "with my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual\n",
      "crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of\n",
      "chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by\n",
      "the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an\n",
      "orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming\n",
      "out \"They're coming, they're coming!\" so that Françoise and I should run\n",
      "too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry\n",
      "stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule\n",
      "by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on\n",
      "their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray\n",
      "taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener's\n",
      "daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in\n",
      "the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The\n",
      "servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed\n",
      "through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and\n",
      "their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering\n",
      "and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel\n",
      "to a river in flood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor children,\" Françoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had\n",
      "reached the railings; \"poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow.\n",
      "It's just shocking to think of,\" she would go on, laying a hand over her\n",
      "heart, where presumably she had felt the shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fine sight, isn't it, Mme. Françoise, all these young fellows not\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that\n",
      "we should care for if it's not our lives, the only gift the Lord never\n",
      "offers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you're right all the same; it's\n",
      "quite true, they don't care! I can remember them in '70; in those wretched\n",
      "wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing more nor less\n",
      "than madmen; and then they aren't worth the price of a rope to hang them\n",
      "with; they're not men any more, they're lions.\" For by her way of\n",
      "thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce\n",
      "'lie-on,' was not at all complimentary to the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see\n",
      "people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap\n",
      "between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make\n",
      "out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight.\n",
      "The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he\n",
      "was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then,\n",
      "suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city,\n",
      "would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a\n",
      "hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water,\n",
      "the news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along\n",
      "without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Méséglise. Françoise\n",
      "and the gardener, having 'made up' their difference, would discuss the\n",
      "line to be followed in case of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you see, Françoise,\" he would say. \"Revolution would be better,\n",
      "because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward.\"\n",

      "all the railways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, to be sure; so that we shan't get away,\" said Françoise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the gardener would assent, with \"Ay, they're the cunning ones,\" for he\n",
      "would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state\n",
      "attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who\n",
      "would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Françoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book,\n",
      "and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch\n",
      "the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage\n",
      "of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal\n",
      "tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Combray. And\n",
      "in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule,\n",
      "'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare,\n",
      "festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border\n",
      "of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the\n",
      "beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself\n",
      "has retreated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read\n",
      "in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the\n",
      "commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had\n",
      "brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had\n",
      "this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a\n",
      "wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different\n",
      "background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the\n",
      "figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than\n",
      "myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name\n",
      "of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the _Nuit d'Octobre_, he had burst\n",
      "out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of\n",
      "warning: \"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He\n",
      "is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am\n",
      "bound to admit, natheless,\" he added graciously, \"that he, and even the\n",
      "man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is\n",
      "not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme\n",
      "merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is\n",
      "\n",
      "  _La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire_,\n",

      "They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two\n",
      "runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is\n",
      "found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is\n",
      "a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended,\n",
      "it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me,\n",
      "its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle,\n",
      "indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a\n",
      "critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is\n",
      "impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has\n",
      "weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical\n",
      "prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed\n",
      "_Bhagavat_ and the _Lévrier de Magnus_ speaks not falsely, then, by\n",
      "Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of\n",
      "Olympus.\" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to\n",
      "call him, and that he himself called me, \"my master.\" But, as a matter of\n",
      "fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism,\n",
      "being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real\n",
      "existence by giving it a name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch,\n",
      "in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had\n",
      "engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I,\n",
      "if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself)\n",
      "were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened,\n",
      "Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well\n",
      "received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I\n",
      "formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home\n",
      "with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have\n",
      "objected on principle—indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish\n",
      "extraction—had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were\n",
      "not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new\n",
      "friend home without my grandfather's humming the \"O, God of our fathers\"\n",
      "from _La Juive_, or else \"Israel, break thy chain,\" singing the tune\n",
      "alone, of course, to an \"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be\n",
      "afraid of my friend's recognising the sound, and so being able to\n",
      "reconstruct the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often\n",
      "as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only\n",
      "the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen\n",
      "people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?\"\n",

      "\"Dumont, grandpapa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dumont! Oh, I'm frightened of Dumont.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he would sing:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Archers, be on your guard!\n",
      "  Watch without rest, without sound,\n",
      "\n",
      "and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call\n",
      "out \"On guard! on guard,\" or, if it were the victim himself who had\n",
      "already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather's\n",
      "subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us\n",
      "that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost\n",
      "inaudibly the air of\n",
      "\n",
      "  What! do you hither guide the feet\n",
      "  Of this timid Israelite?\n",
      "\n",
      "or of\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields,\n",
      "\n",
      "or, perhaps, of\n",
      "\n",
      "  Yes, I am of the chosen race.\n",
      "\n",
      "These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will\n",
      "whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for\n",
      "other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in\n",
      "with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I\n",
      "can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \"Sir, I am absolutely\n",
      "incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart\n",
      "from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me\n",
      "of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor boy,\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \"your friend is out of\n",
      "his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As if\n",
      "there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when\n",
      "she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped\n",
      "the tears from his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\" she observed to me. \"Why he\n",
      "doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a\n",
      "half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made\n",
      "not the least apology, saying merely: \"I never allow myself to be\n",
      "influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by\n",
      "the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly\n",
      "reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I\n",
      "am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more\n",
      "pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the\n",
      "umbrella and the watch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was,\n",
      "of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they\n",
      "had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my\n",
      "grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either\n",

      "at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that\n",
      "we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which\n",
      "he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a\n",
      "prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and\n",
      "elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would\n",

      "loving,\" of the \"moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming\n",

      "inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping\n",
      "which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that\n",
      "imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of\n",
      "Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled\n",
      "me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage\n",
      "bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some\n",
      "innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all\n",
      "obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what\n",
      "had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste\n",

      "philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my\n",
      "having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no\n",

      "Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier,\n",

      "taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally\n",
      "acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and\n",
      "America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement,\n",
      "but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would seem, what Dr.\n",
      "du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I\n",
      "liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and\n",
      "certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such\n",
      "prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and\n",
      "also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was\n",
      "almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his\n",
      "principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some\n",
      "great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off\n",
      "his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer,\n",
      "would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes,\n",
      "remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a\n",
      "rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious\n",
      "when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no\n",
      "precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where\n",
      "it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites\n",
      "also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even\n",
      "disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he\n",
      "spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of\n",
      "pine-forests or of hailstorms, of _Notre-Dame de Paris_, of _Athalie_, or\n",
      "of _Phèdre_, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode\n",
      "and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe\n",
      "contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless\n",
      "to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might\n",
      "have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and\n",
      "especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of\n",
      "seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon\n",
      "some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea,\n",
      "because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed\n",
      "that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon\n",
      "almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no\n",
      "doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from\n",
      "an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced\n",
      "that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected\n",
      "spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to\n",
      "find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own\n",
      "mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity\n",
      "had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be\n",
      "beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte\n",
      "would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I\n",
      "was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so\n",
      "concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of\n",
      "mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later\n",
      "years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some\n",
      "of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to\n",
      "go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in\n",
      "Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I\n",
      "could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety\n",
      "that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my\n",
      "mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life,' I had no\n",
      "time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read!\n",
      "But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really\n",
      "liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were\n",
      "themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but\n",
      "was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon\n",
      "similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of\n",
      "their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and\n",
      "self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for\n",
      "such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare\n",
      "for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I\n",
      "had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family\n",
      "servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of\n",
      "irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother\n",
      "about Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought\n",
      "not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which\n",
      "were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to\n",
      "make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Françoise\n",
      "and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have\n",
      "sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief that he would find them\n",
      "quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own\n",
      "humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I\n",
      "had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in\n",
      "my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the\n",
      "arms of a long-lost father.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and\n",
      "disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any\n",
      "consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my\n",
      "brain, with rather more _dolce_, rather more _lento_ than he himself had,\n",
      "perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with\n",
      "something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than\n",
      "anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged\n",
      "myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age\n",
      "when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called\n",
      "'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but\n",
      "simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I\n",
      "had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow\n",
      "there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the\n",

      "eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes\n",
      "he'll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a\n",
      "charming creature.\" And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte,\n",
      "Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception\n",
      "in my favour and said: \"I know him well; if you would like him to write a\n",
      "few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about\n",
      "his friend. \"Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Actor? No, I can't say. But I do know this: there's not a man on the\n",

      "she's only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don't believe very\n",
      "much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts.\" As he spoke I noticed, what had\n",
      "often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother's sisters,\n",
      "that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression\n",
      "which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he\n",
      "would take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation,\n",
      "mechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between\n",
      "inverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility\n",
      "for it; as who should say \"the 'hierarchy,' don't you know, as silly\n",
      "people call it.\" But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the\n",
      "'hierarchy'? A moment later he went on: \"Her acting will give you as noble\n",
      "an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as—oh, I don't\n",
      "know—\" and he began to laugh, \"shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\"\n",
      "Until then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious\n",

      "dogmatism of my grandmother's sisters; and I had imagined also that it was\n",
      "characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which\n",

      "of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and\n",
      "precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of\n",
      "'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by\n",
      "this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with\n",
      "generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to\n",
      "be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some\n",
      "precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into\n",
      "account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they\n",
      "say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of\n",
      "its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so\n",
      "unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had\n",
      "dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Léon as being of no\n",
      "importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was\n",
      "devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the\n",
      "duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of\n",
      "formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and\n",
      "when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the\n",
      "same, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the\n",
      "manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him\n",
      "justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer's\n",
      "admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and by Dr. du\n",
      "Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: \"He has a charming mind,\n",
      "so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little\n",
      "far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the\n",

      "so far as to say \"He is a great writer, he has great talent.\" They did not\n",
      "even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were\n",
      "not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar\n",
      "physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled 'great talent' in\n",
      "our museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and\n",
      "strange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to\n",

      "which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit\n",

      "Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the\n",
      "famous windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied's brother,\n",
      "who goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a\n",
      "most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the\n",
      "way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it\n",
      "appears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so\n",

      "that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct\n",

      "and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of\n",
      "_Sanctus Hilarius_ are by no means the most curious that have occurred in\n",
      "the names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the\n",
      "case of your own patron, _Sancta Eulalia_; do you know what she has become\n",
      "in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a\n",
      "gentleman. Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a\n",
      "man of you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father will always have his joke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gilbert's brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having\n",
      "early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his\n",
      "mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a\n",
      "man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so\n",
      "that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he\n",
      "would massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing\n",
      "to be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down,\n",
      "the original church, that was, which Théodebert, when he and his court\n",
      "left the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of\n",
      "course, _Theodeberiacus_), to go out and fight the Burgundians, had\n",

      "'Will'am' \"the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit\n",
      "the place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of\n",
      "the people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from\n",

      "climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the\n",

      "that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call\n",
      "vistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On\n",
      "a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you\n",

      "without the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the\n",
      "ditches at Saint-Assise-lès-Combray, which are separated, really, by a\n",

      "canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is _Gaudiacus vicecomitis_, as of course\n",
      "you know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal\n",
      "in one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I\n",
      "saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine\n",
      "how they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of\n",
      "Saint-Hilaire, it's quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread\n",
      "out before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would\n",
      "say that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that\n",
      "it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been\n",
      "cut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don't think I ought to; you know very well that I\n",

      "temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened\n",
      "my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when\n",
      "she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would\n",

      "slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so discreetly passed\n",
      "that Françoise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to\n",

      "enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that\n",
      "the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid\n",
      "in the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy\n",

      "men, on account of my aunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits\n",
      "from the Curé, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which\n",

      "control over my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her\n",
      "highest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers\n",
      "with a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in\n",
      "what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to\n",
      "give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she\n",
      "felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's presents,\n",
      "could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account.\n",
      "Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as\n",
      "Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the\n",

      "Françoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and\n",
      "brilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and\n",
      "paid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile.\n",
      "But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of\n",
      "courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of\n",
      "the class which Françoise would label \"people like myself,\" or \"people no\n",
      "better than myself,\" people whom she despised even more if they did not\n",
      "address her always as \"Mme. Françoise,\" just to shew that they considered\n",
      "themselves to be 'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her\n",
      "warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling\n",
      "money away with both hands (or so, at least, Françoise believed) on\n",
      "undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself\n",

      "ability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her\n",
      "visits to my aunt had 'brought in.' It must be added that Eulalie had\n",
      "formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of\n",
      "Françoise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Françoise would\n",
      "mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at\n",
      "the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to\n",

      "in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like\n",

      "was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or\n",
      "to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and\n",

      "When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my\n",
      "aunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include\n",
      "those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical\n",
      "form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the\n",
      "greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as\n",
      "Françoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin,\n",
      "the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my\n",

      "'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her\n",
      "luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of\n",
      "luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and\n",
      "rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour\n",
      "to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a\n",
      "few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance,\n",
      "followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The\n",
      "return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences,\n",
      "intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and\n",
      "stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the\n",
      "favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which\n",
      "can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a\n",
      "nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic\n",

      "gossiping with Françoise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer\n",
      "than usual, would say, \"You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing\n",
      "that it's Saturday.\" If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled\n",
      "out a watch and said, \"I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\"\n",
      "everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once:\n",
      "\"Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's\n",

      "reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt Léonie about this absurd\n",
      "mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a\n",
      "change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would\n",
      "blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we\n",
      "were late in starting for our walk, said, \"What, only two o'clock!\"\n",

      "on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler\n",
      "had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where\n",
      "only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would\n",

      "of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would\n",
      "prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom\n",
      "the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to\n",
      "these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long\n",

      "having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not\n",

      "the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one\n",
      "another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they\n",
      "were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves,\n",
      "over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little\n",
      "clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them\n",
      "save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed\n",
      "of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the\n",
      "shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy\n",
      "buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public\n",
      "rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had\n",
      "opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly,\n",
      "like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as\n",

      "some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used\n",
      "often to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had\n",

      "compliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of\n",
      "his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried\n",
      "politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting\n",
      "himself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing\n",
      "egotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were\n",
      "his own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I\n",

      "of music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he\n",
      "had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt,\n",
      "of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave\n",
      "him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that\n",
      "my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his\n",
      "playing, he had hurriedly protested: \"I cannot think who put that on the\n",

      "when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with\n",
      "spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My\n",
      "grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid\n",
      "expression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted\n",
      "all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had\n",
      "spoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her\n",

      "a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a\n",

      "an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mlle.\n",
      "Vinteuil's cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless\n",
      "silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the\n",

      "like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded\n",
      "by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept\n",

      "If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had\n",
      "been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more\n",
      "sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless,\n",
      "schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was\n",
      "angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a\n",
      "cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which\n",
      "she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for\n",
      "ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring\n",
      "before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of\n",
      "taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction,\n",
      "would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother's utter\n",
      "incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she\n",
      "might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius.\n",
      "Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its\n",
      "long legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the\n",
      "wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because\n",
      "every year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special\n",
      "care, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before\n",
      "the train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed\n",
      "across the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to\n",
      "me, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la\n",
      "Gare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of\n",
      "their gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had\n",
      "scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water\n",
      "and gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office.\n",
      "All that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the\n",
      "beauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my\n",
      "weary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the\n",
      "lime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of\n",
      "great suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates\n",
      "far apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set\n",
      "up an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the\n",
      "evenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray\n",

      "He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had\n",
      "slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out\n",

      "Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over\n",

      "upon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from\n",
      "the logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time\n",
      "to time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor\n",
      "catastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile\n",
      "herself with a sudden suspicion that Françoise had been robbing her, that\n",
      "she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer\n",
      "red-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by\n",
      "herself, of playing her own and her adversary's hands at once, she would\n",
      "first stammer out Françoise's awkward apologies, and then reply to them\n",
      "with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon\n",
      "her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her\n",
      "eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her\n",
      "brows. Françoise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant\n",
      "sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not\n",
      "have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to\n",
      "remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and\n",
      "reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes,\n",
      "however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must\n",
      "see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously\n",
      "closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Françoise's integrity\n",
      "and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would\n",
      "confide in Françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom\n",
      "the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and,\n",
      "disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be 'as thick as\n",
      "thieves' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two\n",
      "would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie\n",
      "might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which\n",
      "must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her\n",
      "in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was\n",
      "Françoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was\n",
      "perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave\n",
      "her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for\n",
      "herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And\n",
      "so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt,\n",
      "at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being\n",
      "concealed from her by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive\n",
      "movement of Françoise's features, something contradictory in what she was\n",
      "saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would\n",
      "shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise\n",
      "turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in\n",
      "driving into her unhappy servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a\n",
      "disclosure by Eulalie—like one of those discoveries which suddenly open\n",
      "up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has\n",
      "hitherto followed only the beaten paths—proved to my aunt that her own\n",
      "worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. \"But\n",
      "Françoise ought to know that,\" said Eulalie, \"now that you have given her\n",
      "a carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\" gasped my aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in\n",
      "her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I\n",
      "supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter,\n",
      "could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices. My\n",
      "mother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my\n",
      "aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that\n",
      "might be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely\n",
      "scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to\n",
      "ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up\n",
      "her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she\n",
      "would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her\n",
      "face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this\n",
      "way—whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth\n",
      "century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would\n",
      "consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed\n",
      "a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when\n",
      "he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of\n",
      "Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking\n",
      "to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere\n",
      "outward forms—a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no\n",
      "more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible\n",
      "eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter\n",
      "idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought\n",
      "to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning\n",
      "toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their\n",
      "despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in\n",
      "what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and\n",
      "was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good\n",
      "humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with\n",
      "matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did\n",
      "the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier,\n",
      "or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the\n",
      "turning of an avenue, at Versailles.\n",
      "\n",
      "One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé\n",
      "and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole\n",
      "family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole\n",
      "with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to\n",
      "her door at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Léonie,\" she said kindly,\n",
      "\"you have had all your friends here at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And my great-aunt interrupted with: \"Too many good things...\"\n",
      "for, since her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to\n",
      "revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the\n",
      "brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to take advantage,\" he said, \"of the whole family's being\n",
      "here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over\n",
      "again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's bad\n",
      "books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with\n",
      "him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went\n",
      "downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,\n",
      "which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and\n",
      "excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by\n",
      "the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once\n",
      "friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had\n",
      "barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as\n",
      "though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic\n",
      "of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly\n",
      "receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far\n",
      "end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they\n",
      "content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible\n",
      "movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known\n",
      "and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for\n",
      "amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked\n",
      "himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\" he\n",
      "said, \"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is\n",
      "something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties,\n",
      "so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost,\n",
      "which is really attractive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had\n",
      "imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question,\n",
      "had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father's\n",
      "fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned\n",
      "from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on\n",
      "account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came\n",
      "up to us with outstretched hand: \"Do you know, master book-lover,\" he\n",
      "asked me, \"this line of Paul Desjardins?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never\n",
      "read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is\n",
      "converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the\n",
      "most charming water-colour touch—\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even\n",
      "when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all\n",
      "black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself,\n",
      "as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\" He took a cigarette from his\n",
      "pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. \"Goodbye,\n",
      "friends!\" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for\n",
      "dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Françoise, a colonel\n",
      "with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales\n",
      "where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the\n",
      "coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing\n",
      "over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready\n",
      "in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter's craft,\n",
      "which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to\n",
      "jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and\n",
      "included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I\n",
      "would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to\n",
      "inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little\n",
      "green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the\n",
      "asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their\n",
      "heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of\n",
      "imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the\n",
      "soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world.\n",
      "I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite\n",
      "creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the\n",
      "disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern\n",
      "in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue\n",
      "evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when,\n",
      "all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played\n",
      "(lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's\n",
      "_Dream_) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic\n",
      "perfume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Françoise with\n",
      "the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her\n",
      "in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the\n",
      "world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the\n",
      "asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately\n",
      "outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers banded about\n",
      "the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And,\n",
      "meanwhile, Françoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens,\n",
      "such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad\n",
      "from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was\n",
      "serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness\n",
      "predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the\n",
      "aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so\n",
      "tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many\n",
      "virtues.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon\n",
      "our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of\n",
      "those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent\n",
      "confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Françoise, being\n",
      "without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in\n",
      "the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a\n",
      "chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Françoise,\n",
      "beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the\n",
      "ear, accompanied with shrill cries of \"Filthy creature! Filthy creature!\"\n",
      "it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less\n",
      "prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its\n",
      "appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious\n",
      "juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead\n",
      "Françoise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not\n",
      "let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and,\n",
      "gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final \"Filthy\n",
      "creature!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have\n",
      "prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Françoise. But who would have\n",
      "baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even—roasted\n",
      "me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to\n",
      "make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt Léonie knew (though I was\n",
      "still in ignorance of this) that Françoise, who, for her own daughter or\n",
      "for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a\n",
      "singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In\n",
      "spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her\n",
      "cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise\n",
      "that Françoise's kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues\n",
      "concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to\n",
      "us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling\n",
      "with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression\n",
      "and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own\n",
      "kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which\n",
      "increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from\n",
      "herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the\n",
      "misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly\n",
      "stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of\n",
      "the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid\n",
      "was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose\n",
      "and awakened Françoise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry\n",
      "was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the\n",
      "house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a\n",
      "marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the\n",
      "symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we\n",
      "would find the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent\n",
      "Françoise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out.\n",
      "An hour elapsed, and Françoise had not returned; my mother, supposing that\n",
      "she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the\n",
      "bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Françoise who, in\n",
      "her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the\n",
      "clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that\n",
      "it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At\n",
      "each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: \"Oh, oh,\n",
      "Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to\n",
      "suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto's\n",

      "that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew,\n",
      "having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any\n",
      "other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation\n",
      "at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the\n",
      "kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed\n",
      "account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but\n",
      "ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she\n",
      "thought that we had gone out of earshot: \"Well, she need never have done\n",
      "what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant\n",
      "enough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same,\n",

      "trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid\n",
      "recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin's\n",
      "hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this\n",
      "undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least\n",
      "hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the\n",
      "wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind\n",
      "suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the\n",
      "one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and\n",
      "while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid\n",
      "and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on\n",
      "his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to\n",
      "hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his\n",
      "shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most\n",
      "absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself\n",
      "to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless\n",
      "and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out\n",
      "through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred\n",
      "to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed\n",
      "to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a\n",
      "point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to\n",
      "acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of\n",
      "innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though\n",
      "conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into\n",
      "surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by\n",
      "the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like\n",
      "the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we\n",
      "reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the\n",
      "'Saint-Honoré,' and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to\n",
      "send it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us\n",
      "with the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past\n",
      "us, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of\n",
      "the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to\n",
      "speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of\n",
      "his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but,\n",
      "striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat\n",
      "restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue\n",
      "chink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of\n",
      "cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the\n",
      "border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship\n",
      "into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret\n",
      "understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally\n",
      "exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of\n",
      "affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us\n",
      "alone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon\n",

      "father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which\n",
      "Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty\n",
      "as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals\n",
      "a man's deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has\n",
      "previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit's\n",
      "evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our\n",
      "own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and\n",
      "incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not\n",
      "been the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes,\n",

      "I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said,\n",

      "Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy,\n",
      "that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my\n",
      "courage and said to him: \"Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the\n",
      "lady—the ladies of Guermantes?\" and I felt glad because, in pronouncing\n",
      "the name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of\n",

      "fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been stiffened\n",
      "and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and smiled, while\n",
      "his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a good-looking martyr\n",
      "whose body bristles with arrows.\n",

      "befitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word, leaning\n",
      "forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man gives, so\n",
      "as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though the fact\n",
      "that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some strange\n",
      "accident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding himself\n",
      "unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation, chooses\n",
      "to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the confession he\n",
      "is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is easy, agreeable,\n",
      "spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this case the absence of\n",
      "relations with the Guermantes family, might very well have been not forced\n",
      "upon, but actually designed by Legrandin himself, might arise from some\n",

      "a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that Legrandin was\n",
      "not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches,\n",
      "moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very great deal, for\n",
      "people who lived in country houses, and would be so much afraid, when in\n",

      "truth must be known, that it should be revealed in his absence, when he\n",
      "was out of earshot, that judgment should go against him (if so it must) by\n",

      "spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad\n",

      "\n",
      "This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he\n",
      "inveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least)\n",
      "be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of\n",
      "others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out\n",
      "about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon\n",
      "ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which\n",
      "substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives, less\n",
      "stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin's snobbishness\n",
      "impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it\n",
      "would set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin's\n",
      "eyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the duchess,\n",
      "assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her\n",
      "mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of snobs could never\n",
      "understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was of their number, for,\n",
      "owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his\n",

      "Legrandin and their primary cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin, and\n",

      "greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which he\n",
      "continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my father, he\n",
      "found it difficult to take Legrandin's airs in so light, in so detached a\n",
      "spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending me to spend the\n",
      "long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: \"I must, most\n",
      "certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to Balbec, to see whether he\n",

      "already, in her mind's eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de Cambremer,\n",
      "alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on\n",
      "the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain indoors all\n",
      "afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to scorn, for she\n",
      "herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and that Legrandin\n",
      "would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister. And, as\n",
      "it happened, there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of\n",
      "Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who, without the least suspicion that\n",
      "we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts, walked into the\n",

      "Vivonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are\n",
      "very beautiful, are they not, my friend?\" he said to my father.\n",
      "\"Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria\n",
      "blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud\n",
      "there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea?\n",
      "Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where\n",
      "Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious\n",
      "examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down\n",
      "there, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so\n",
      "uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of\n",
      "the Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets (which, all the same, I am\n",
      "very far from despising) seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that\n",
      "moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into\n",
      "blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often\n",
      "lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and\n",
      "then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering\n",
      "of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay,\n",
      "which they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still\n",
      "from being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the\n",
      "surrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its\n",
      "wrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the\n",
      "perils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that\n",
      "underlies our soil, the true Ar-mor, the sea, the land's end, the accursed\n",
      "region which Anatole France—an enchanter whose works our young friend\n",
      "ought to read—has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though\n",
      "it were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes,\n",
      "they are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient\n",
      "and charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it\n",
      "is, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive\n",
      "and so entrancing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?\" inquired my father. \"This\n",
      "young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his\n",
      "grandmother, and my wife too, perhaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Legrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking\n",
      "directly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so\n",
      "concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity—smiling mournfully the\n",
      "while—upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness and\n",
      "frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he seemed\n",
      "to have penetrated my father's skull, as it had been a ball of glass, and\n",
      "to be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it, a brightly\n",
      "coloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and would enable\n",
      "him to establish the theory that, just when he was being asked whether he\n",
      "knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking of something else, and so had\n",
      "not heard the question. As a rule these tactics make the questioner\n",
      "proceed to ask, \"Why, what are you thinking about?\" But my father,\n",
      "inquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: \"Have you friends, then, in\n",
      "that neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled to\n",
      "the extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and distraction;\n",
      "then feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it now but to\n",
      "answer, he said to us: \"I have friends all the world over, wherever there\n",
      "are companies of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come\n",

      "inclement sky which has no mercy upon them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is not quite what I meant,\" interrupted my father, obstinate as a\n",

      "happen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all\n",
      "alone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the\n",
      "people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,\" replied\n",
      "Legrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; \"places I know\n",
      "well, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem to\n",
      "me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality\n",
      "which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps it\n",
      "is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff's edge; standing there by\n",
      "the roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an\n",
      "evening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing; while\n",
      "the fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of the\n",
      "Channel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours. Or\n",
      "perhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if\n",
      "anything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some\n",
      "imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which knows\n",
      "not truth,\" he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, \"that land of\n",
      "infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly not what\n",
      "I should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is already so\n",
      "much inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed to receive\n",
      "its impressions. Climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets\n",
      "may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself; but they must\n",
      "always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed. Believe me,\"\n",
      "he went on with emphasis, \"the waters of that bay—more Breton than\n",
      "Norman—may exert a sedative influence, though even that is of\n",
      "questionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no longer unbroken,\n",
      "a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate. But at\n",
      "your age, my boy, those waters are contra-indicated... Good night to you,\n",

      "physicianly finger raised in warning, he resumed the consultation: \"No\n",

      "the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the\n",

      "in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the\n",
      "light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain\n",
      "intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same\n",
      "charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it\n",
      "any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred\n",
      "times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned\n",

      "renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge,\n",
      "rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its\n",
      "fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated\n",
      "the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a\n",
      "tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme\n",
      "which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced\n",
      "apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a\n",

      "rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy\n",
      "of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a\n",
      "wayfarer's when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and\n",

      "and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of\n",
      "a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect,\n",
      "framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in\n",
      "its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we\n",
      "could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity,\n",
      "blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the\n",
      "most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward.\n",
      "Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: \"Good morning,\n",
      "Françoise.\" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin,\n",
      "which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we\n",
      "had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise.\n",
      "We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed\n",
      "the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener\n",
      "relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family'\n",
      "(for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites\n",
      "the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh\n",
      "charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would\n",
      "she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so\n",
      "bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was\n",
      "often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her\n",
      "nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to\n",
      "make of him, and whether he took after his granny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Françoise\n",
      "was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would\n",
      "speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and\n",
      "their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had guessed that Françoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and\n",
      "that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the\n",
      "two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when\n",
      "Françoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to\n",
      "her, with a smile: \"Tell me, Françoise, if Julien has had to go away, and\n",
      "you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will\n",
      "make the best of it, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Françoise answered, laughing: \"Madame knows everything; Madame is\n",

      "difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman's,\n",
      "daring to employ a scientific term) \"they brought here for Mme. Octave,\n",
      "which see what is in your heart\"—and she went off, disturbed that anyone\n",

      "the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills\n",
      "seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did\n",
      "everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well\n",
      "or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the\n",
      "only one of my aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black\n",
      "coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants\n",
      "who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger,\n",
      "doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew\n",
      "him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of\n",
      "him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will\n",
      "be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to\n",
      "those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real\n",
      "capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that\n",
      "slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often\n",
      "conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can\n",

      "In this way Françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them,\n",
      "in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the\n",

      "an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for\n",

      "be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen\n",
      "satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to\n",
      "luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still\n",
      "before enjoying the spectacle. \"And it will come in the middle of my\n",
      "luncheon!\" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a\n",
      "distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same\n",
      "time.\"At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of\n",
      "the flat plates?\" These were the only plates which had pictures on them\n",
      "and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description\n",
      "on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her\n",
      "spectacles and spell out: \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\" \"Aladdin, or\n",
      "the Wonderful Lamp,\" and smile, and say \"Very good indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I may as well go across to Camus...\" Françoise would hazard, seeing that\n",

      "\n",
      "But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for\n",

      "forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue\n",
      "du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena,\n",
      "careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous\n",
      "monster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know,' either\n",
      "personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or\n",
      "less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be\n",

      "thought that there might be in Combray people whom you 'didn't know at\n",
      "all,' simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at\n",
      "once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Curé had given warning\n",
      "that they expected their 'strangers.' In the evening, when I came in and\n",
      "went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash\n",

      "my grandfather didn't know:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man grandfather didn't know at all!\" she would exclaim. \"That's a\n",
      "likely story.\" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news,\n",
      "she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would\n",
      "be summoned. \"Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux,\n",

      "which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to\n",
      "upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in\n",
      "Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a\n",
      "dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it\n",
      "incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all\n",

      "\n",
      "\"As if I didn't know Mme. Sazerat's dog!\"—for my aunt's critical mind\n",

      "left you; I can't afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it's nearly\n",

      "going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had\n",

      "to so pure a piece of 'nature,' this little sign of art, this single\n",
      "indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the\n",
      "remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side,\n",

      "It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and\n",

      "Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the\n",
      "blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass,\n",
      "penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or\n",

      "beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had\n",
      "correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds\n",
      "wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate\n",

      "houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without\n",

      "with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material\n",
      "so different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is\n",
      "at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two\n",
      "pretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the\n",
      "beach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret\n",
      "and gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of\n",
      "the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second,\n",
      "and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet\n",
      "bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the\n",
      "atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact,\n",
      "nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this\n",
      "view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But\n",
      "since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may\n",
      "have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an\n",
      "element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a\n",
      "thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel,\n",
      "so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost\n",

      "heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which\n",
      "dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected\n",
      "pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have\n",

      "friends!\" had replied: \"Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you\n",
      "may last a while yet\"; each party alike might be certain that her doors\n",

      "for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had\n",
      "to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret\n",
      "admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these\n",
      "other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In\n",
      "short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to\n",
      "see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her\n",
      "sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a\n",
      "minute: \"The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!\", twenty times Eulalie\n",
      "would retort with: \"Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will\n",
      "live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.\" For one\n",
      "of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of\n",
      "corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to\n",
      "eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme. Sazerin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not ask to live to a hundred,\" my aunt would say, for she preferred\n",

      "And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to\n",

      "regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent\n",
      "them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those\n",
      "days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at\n",
      "once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie\n",
      "were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of\n",
      "waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from\n",
      "looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms\n",
      "in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end\n",
      "of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her\n",
      "ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than\n",
      "this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Françoise would\n",
      "become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go\n",
      "upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But—and this more than ever from the day on\n",
      "which fine weather definitely set in at Combray—the proud hour °f noon,\n",
      "descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a\n",
      "moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have\n",
      "echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in,\n",
      "after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in\n",
      "front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day,\n",
      "and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of\n",
      "eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the\n",
      "table she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add—as the labour of\n",
      "fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets,\n",
      "the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so\n",
      "effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved\n",
      "on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some\n",
      "extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life—a brill,\n",
      "because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she\n",
      "had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with\n",
      "marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast\n",
      "leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be\n",
      "plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner;\n",
      "spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to\n",
      "get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left;\n",
      "raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to\n",
      "come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years;\n",
      "a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond\n",
      "cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf,\n",
      "because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all these had\n",
      "been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more\n",
      "particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of\n",
      "chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Françoise, would\n",
      "be laid before us, light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music,\n",
      "into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to\n",
      "partake of it, saying: \"No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\"\n",
      "would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when\n",
      "an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and\n",
      "material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his\n",
      "signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have\n",
      "shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the\n",
      "'piece' was still being played, and under the composer's-very eyes.\n",

      "grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a\n",
      "major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its\n",
      "opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which\n",
      "seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet\n",
      "fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of\n",
      "existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a\n",
      "disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle\n",
      "Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel\n",

      "sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a\n",
      "plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of\n",
      "striped linen, purple and white. He would complain that I had not been to\n",
      "see him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a\n",
      "marchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever\n",
      "sat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded\n",
      "mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its\n",
      "furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents', only yellow; then\n",
      "we would enter what he called his 'study,' a room whose walls were hung\n",
      "with prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy\n",
      "goddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her\n",
      "brow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there\n",
      "was thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were\n",
      "then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect\n",
      "again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they\n",
      "may advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I\n",
      "would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the\n",
      "coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle\n",
      "would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood\n",
      "there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and\n",
      "waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a\n",
      "supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words:\n",
      "\"A quarter past two,\" which the servant would echo with amazement, but\n",

      "capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the\n",

      "enjoyment. Between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and\n",

      "Î felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should\n",
      "have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I\n",

      "petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew\n",
      "him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from\n",
      "so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that,\n",
      "in doing so I was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and\n",

      "an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity\n",
      "and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in\n",

      "so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she\n",
      "was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious\n",
      "casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be\n",
      "detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the\n",

      "poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her,\n",
      "even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did\n",

      "of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an\n",
      "ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion\n",

      "extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of\n",
      "sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to\n",

      "this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented\n",
      "with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so\n",

      "essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that\n",
      "simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple,\n",

      "emotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he\n",
      "has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The\n",

      "sections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial\n",
      "sections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself.\n",

      "are holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the\n",
      "book, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has\n",
      "brought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every\n",

      "revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our\n",
      "perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is\n",
      "our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by\n",

      "a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression—one which I\n",
      "hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and\n",
      "never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly\n",
      "conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised—of\n",

      "borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break\n",
      "out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly,\n",
      "all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the\n",
      "resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things,\n",
      "endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves\n",
      "have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in\n",
      "themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds,\n",
      "to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our\n",

      "other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside\n",
      "ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the\n",
      "woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the\n",
      "time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to\n",
      "them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the\n",
      "mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my\n",
      "dreams of travel and of love were only moments—which I isolate\n",
      "artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different\n",
      "heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or\n",

      "of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good\n",
      "scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour\n",
      "chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already\n",
      "spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke\n",
      "which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that\n",

      "which Françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and\n",
      "refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my\n",
      "book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds\n",
      "only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself,\n",
      "close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface, and I would be unable to\n",
      "believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue\n",
      "which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would\n",
      "even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than\n",
      "the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike;\n",
      "something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the\n",
      "fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had\n",
      "stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden\n",
      "bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday\n",
      "afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I\n",
      "was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life,\n",
      "replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land\n",
      "watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions\n",
      "to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue\n",
      "of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on\n",
      "with my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual\n",
      "crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of\n",
      "chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by\n",
      "the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an\n",
      "orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming\n",
      "out \"They're coming, they're coming!\" so that Françoise and I should run\n",
      "too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry\n",
      "stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule\n",
      "by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on\n",
      "their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray\n",
      "taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener's\n",
      "daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in\n",
      "the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The\n",
      "servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed\n",
      "through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and\n",
      "their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering\n",
      "and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel\n",
      "to a river in flood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor children,\" Françoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had\n",
      "reached the railings; \"poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow.\n",
      "It's just shocking to think of,\" she would go on, laying a hand over her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A fine sight, isn't it, Mme. Françoise, all these young fellows not\n",
      "caring two straws for their lives?\" the gardener would ask, just to 'draw'\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that\n",
      "we should care for if it's not our lives, the only gift the Lord never\n",
      "offers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you're right all the same; it's\n",
      "quite true, they don't care! I can remember them in '70; in those wretched\n",
      "wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing more nor less\n",
      "than madmen; and then they aren't worth the price of a rope to hang them\n",
      "with; they're not men any more, they're lions.\" For by her way of\n",
      "thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce\n",
      "'lie-on,' was not at all complimentary to the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see\n",
      "people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap\n",
      "between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make\n",
      "out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight.\n",
      "The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he\n",
      "was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then,\n",
      "suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city,\n",
      "would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a\n",
      "hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water,\n",
      "the news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along\n",
      "without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Méséglise. Françoise\n",
      "and the gardener, having 'made up' their difference, would discuss the\n",
      "line to be followed in case of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you see, Françoise,\" he would say. \"Revolution would be better,\n",
      "because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward.\"\n",

      "all the railways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, to be sure; so that we shan't get away,\" said Françoise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the gardener would assent, with \"Ay, they're the cunning ones,\" for he\n",
      "would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state\n",
      "attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who\n",
      "would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Françoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book,\n",
      "and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch\n",
      "the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage\n",
      "of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal\n",
      "tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Combray. And\n",
      "in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule,\n",
      "'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare,\n",
      "festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border\n",
      "of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the\n",
      "beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself\n",
      "has retreated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read\n",
      "in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the\n",
      "commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had\n",
      "brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had\n",
      "this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a\n",
      "wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different\n",
      "background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the\n",
      "figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than\n",
      "myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name\n",
      "of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the _Nuit d'Octobre_, he had burst\n",
      "out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of\n",
      "warning: \"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He\n",
      "is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am\n",
      "bound to admit, natheless,\" he added graciously, \"that he, and even the\n",
      "man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is\n",
      "not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme\n",
      "merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is\n",
      "\n",
      "  _La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire_,\n",
      "\n",
      "and the other\n",

      "  _La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë_.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two\n",
      "runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is\n",
      "found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is\n",
      "a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended,\n",
      "it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me,\n",
      "its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle,\n",
      "indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a\n",
      "critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is\n",
      "impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has\n",
      "weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical\n",
      "prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed\n",
      "_Bhagavat_ and the _Lévrier de Magnus_ speaks not falsely, then, by\n",
      "Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of\n",
      "Olympus.\" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to\n",
      "call him, and that he himself called me, \"my master.\" But, as a matter of\n",
      "fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism,\n",
      "being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real\n",
      "existence by giving it a name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch,\n",
      "in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had\n",
      "engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I,\n",
      "if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself)\n",
      "were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened,\n",
      "Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well\n",
      "received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I\n",
      "formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home\n",
      "with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have\n",
      "objected on principle—indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish\n",
      "extraction—had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were\n",
      "not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new\n",
      "friend home without my grandfather's humming the \"O, God of our fathers\"\n",
      "from _La Juive_, or else \"Israel, break thy chain,\" singing the tune\n",
      "alone, of course, to an \"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be\n",
      "afraid of my friend's recognising the sound, and so being able to\n",
      "reconstruct the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often\n",
      "as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only\n",
      "the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen\n",
      "people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dumont, grandpapa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dumont! Oh, I'm frightened of Dumont.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he would sing:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Archers, be on your guard!\n",
      "  Watch without rest, without sound,\n",
      "\n",
      "and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call\n",
      "out \"On guard! on guard,\" or, if it were the victim himself who had\n",
      "already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather's\n",
      "subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us\n",
      "that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost\n",
      "inaudibly the air of\n",
      "\n",
      "  What! do you hither guide the feet\n",
      "  Of this timid Israelite?\n",
      "\n",
      "or of\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields,\n",
      "\n",
      "or, perhaps, of\n",
      "\n",
      "  Yes, I am of the chosen race.\n",
      "\n",
      "These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will\n",
      "whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for\n",
      "other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in\n",
      "with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I\n",
      "can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \"Sir, I am absolutely\n",
      "incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart\n",
      "from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me\n",
      "of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor boy,\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \"your friend is out of\n",
      "his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As if\n",
      "there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when\n",
      "she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped\n",
      "the tears from his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\" she observed to me. \"Why he\n",
      "doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a\n",
      "half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made\n",
      "not the least apology, saying merely: \"I never allow myself to be\n",
      "influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by\n",
      "the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly\n",
      "reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I\n",
      "am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more\n",
      "pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the\n",
      "umbrella and the watch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was,\n",
      "of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they\n",
      "had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my\n",
      "grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either\n",
      "instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive\n",
      "emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct\n",
      "of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our\n",
      "friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have\n",
      "a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in\n",
      "these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred\n",
      "to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more\n",
      "than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to\n",
      "give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit\n",
      "because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection,\n",
      "but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any\n",
      "single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the\n",
      "duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales\n",
      "to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from\n",
      "the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my\n",
      "great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a\n",
      "niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in\n",
      "which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was\n",
      "her next-of-kin, and it was the 'proper thing' to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the\n",
      "insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely\n",
      "meaningless' beauty of _La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë_ tired me more\n",
      "and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with\n",
      "him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he\n",
      "would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same\n",
      "night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great\n",
      "influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more\n",
      "unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there\n",
      "was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone\n",
      "on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that\n",
      "my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger days, and had\n",
      "been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing on so important\n",
      "a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was\n",
      "not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me\n",
      "with extreme coldness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head\n",
      "and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment\n",
      "'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style\n",
      "had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of\n",
      "his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story\n",
      "alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman\n",
      "at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that\n",
      "we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which\n",
      "he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a\n",
      "prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and\n",
      "elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would\n",
      "begin to speak of the \"vain dream of life,\" of the \"inexhaustible torrent\n",
      "of fair forms,\" of the \"sterile, splendid torture of understanding and\n",
      "loving,\" of the \"moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming\n",
      "and venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he would express a whole\n",
      "system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the\n",
      "inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping\n",
      "which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that\n",
      "imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of\n",
      "Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled\n",
      "me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage\n",
      "bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some\n",

      "acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and\n",

      "principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some\n",
      "great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off\n",
      "his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer,\n",
      "would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes,\n",
      "remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a\n",
      "rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious\n",
      "when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no\n",
      "precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where\n",
      "it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites\n",
      "also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even\n",
      "disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he\n",
      "spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of\n",
      "pine-forests or of hailstorms, of _Notre-Dame de Paris_, of _Athalie_, or\n",
      "of _Phèdre_, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode\n",
      "and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe\n",
      "contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless\n",
      "to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might\n",
      "have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and\n",
      "especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of\n",
      "seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon\n",
      "some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea,\n",
      "because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed\n",
      "that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon\n",
      "almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no\n",
      "doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from\n",
      "an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced\n",
      "that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected\n",

      "mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity\n",
      "had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be\n",
      "beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte\n",
      "would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I\n",
      "was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so\n",
      "concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of\n",
      "mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later\n",
      "years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some\n",
      "of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to\n",
      "go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in\n",
      "Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I\n",

      "that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my\n",
      "mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life,' I had no\n",
      "time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read!\n",
      "But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really\n",
      "liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were\n",
      "themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but\n",
      "was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon\n",
      "similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of\n",
      "their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and\n",
      "self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for\n",
      "such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare\n",
      "for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I\n",
      "had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family\n",
      "servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of\n",
      "irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother\n",
      "about Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought\n",
      "not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which\n",

      "sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief that he would find them\n",
      "quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own\n",
      "humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I\n",
      "had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in\n",
      "my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the\n",
      "arms of a long-lost father.\n",

      "From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and\n",
      "disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any\n",
      "consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my\n",
      "brain, with rather more _dolce_, rather more _lento_ than he himself had,\n",
      "perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with\n",
      "something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than\n",
      "anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged\n",
      "myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age\n",
      "when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called\n",
      "'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but\n",
      "simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I\n",
      "had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow\n",

      "he'll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a\n",
      "charming creature.\" And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte,\n",
      "Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception\n",
      "in my favour and said: \"I know him well; if you would like him to write a\n",
      "few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about\n",
      "his friend. \"Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Actor? No, I can't say. But I do know this: there's not a man on the\n",

      "she's only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don't believe very\n",
      "much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts.\" As he spoke I noticed, what had\n",
      "often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother's sisters,\n",
      "that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression\n",
      "which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he\n",
      "would take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation,\n",
      "mechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between\n",
      "inverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility\n",
      "for it; as who should say \"the 'hierarchy,' don't you know, as silly\n",
      "people call it.\" But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the\n",
      "'hierarchy'? A moment later he went on: \"Her acting will give you as noble\n",
      "an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as—oh, I don't\n",
      "know—\" and he began to laugh, \"shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\"\n",

      "dogmatism of my grandmother's sisters; and I had imagined also that it was\n",
      "characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which\n",

      "of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and\n",
      "precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of\n",
      "'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by\n",
      "this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with\n",
      "generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to\n",
      "be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some\n",
      "precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into\n",
      "account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they\n",
      "say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of\n",
      "its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so\n",
      "unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had\n",
      "dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Léon as being of no\n",
      "importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was\n",
      "devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the\n",
      "duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of\n",
      "formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and\n",
      "when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the\n",

      "manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him\n",
      "justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer's\n",
      "admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and by Dr. du\n",
      "Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: \"He has a charming mind,\n",
      "so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little\n",
      "far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the\n",

      "so far as to say \"He is a great writer, he has great talent.\" They did not\n",
      "even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were\n",
      "not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar\n",

      "our museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and\n",
      "strange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to\n",

      "which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit\n",
      "synchronised exactly with Eulalie's it became frankly distasteful to my\n",
      "aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to\n",
      "have had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not\n",

      "who goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a\n",
      "most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the\n",
      "way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it\n",

      "that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he\n",
      "would massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing\n",
      "to be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down,\n",
      "the original church, that was, which Théodebert, when he and his court\n",
      "left the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of\n",

      "slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so discreetly passed\n",

      "control over my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her\n",

      "what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to\n",
      "give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she\n",
      "felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's presents,\n",
      "could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account.\n",

      "But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of\n",
      "courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of\n",

      "better than myself,\" people whom she despised even more if they did not\n",

      "themselves to be 'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her\n",
      "warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling\n",
      "money away with both hands (or so, at least, Françoise believed) on\n",
      "undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself\n",

      "visits to my aunt had 'brought in.' It must be added that Eulalie had\n",
      "formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of\n",
      "Françoise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Françoise would\n",
      "mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at\n",
      "the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to\n",
      "'look pleasant.' But she would make up for that after the other's\n",

      "in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like\n",

      "Françoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning,\n",
      "her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning,\n",
      "my mother said to me: \"Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the\n",

      "to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a\n",
      "few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance,\n",
      "followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The\n",
      "return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences,\n",
      "intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and\n",
      "stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the\n",
      "favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which\n",
      "can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a\n",

      "prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom\n",
      "the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to\n",

      "over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little\n",
      "clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them\n",
      "save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed\n",
      "of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the\n",
      "shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy\n",
      "buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public\n",
      "rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had\n",
      "opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly,\n",

      "of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave\n",
      "him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that\n",
      "my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his\n",

      "If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had\n",
      "been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more\n",
      "sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless,\n",
      "schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was\n",
      "angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a\n",
      "cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which\n",
      "she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for\n",

      "before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of\n",
      "taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction,\n",
      "would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother's utter\n",
      "incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she\n",

      "Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its\n",
      "long legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the\n",
      "wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because\n",
      "every year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special\n",
      "care, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before\n",
      "the train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed\n",
      "across the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to\n",
      "me, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la\n",
      "Gare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of\n",
      "their gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had\n",
      "scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water\n",
      "and gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office.\n",
      "All that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the\n",
      "beauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my\n",

      "far apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set\n",
      "up an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the\n",

      "He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had\n",
      "slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out\n",

      "Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over\n",

      "with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty\n",

      "all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her\n",

      "her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her\n",
      "eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her\n",
      "brows. Françoise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant\n",
      "sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not\n",
      "have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to\n",
      "remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and\n",
      "reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes,\n",
      "however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must\n",
      "see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously\n",
      "closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Françoise's integrity\n",
      "and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would\n",
      "confide in Françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom\n",
      "the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and,\n",
      "disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be 'as thick as\n",
      "thieves' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two\n",
      "would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie\n",
      "might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which\n",
      "must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her\n",
      "in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was\n",
      "Françoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was\n",
      "perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave\n",
      "her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for\n",
      "herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And\n",
      "so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt,\n",
      "at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being\n",
      "concealed from her by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive\n",
      "movement of Françoise's features, something contradictory in what she was\n",
      "saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would\n",
      "shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise\n",
      "turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in\n",
      "driving into her unhappy servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a\n",
      "disclosure by Eulalie—like one of those discoveries which suddenly open\n",
      "up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has\n",
      "hitherto followed only the beaten paths—proved to my aunt that her own\n",
      "worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. \"But\n",
      "Françoise ought to know that,\" said Eulalie, \"now that you have given her\n",
      "a carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\" gasped my aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in\n",
      "her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I\n",
      "supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter,\n",
      "could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices. My\n",
      "mother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my\n",
      "aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that\n",
      "might be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely\n",
      "scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to\n",

      "face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this\n",
      "way—whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth\n",
      "century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would\n",
      "consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed\n",
      "a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when\n",
      "he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of\n",
      "Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking\n",
      "to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere\n",
      "outward forms—a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no\n",

      "toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their\n",
      "despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in\n",
      "what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and\n",
      "was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good\n",
      "humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with\n",
      "matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did\n",
      "the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier,\n",

      "One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé\n",

      "And my great-aunt interrupted with: \"Too many good things...\"\n",
      "for, since her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to\n",
      "revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the\n",
      "brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to take advantage,\" he said, \"of the whole family's being\n",
      "here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over\n",
      "again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's bad\n",
      "books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with\n",
      "him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went\n",
      "downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,\n",
      "which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and\n",
      "excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by\n",
      "the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once\n",
      "friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had\n",
      "barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as\n",
      "though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic\n",
      "of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly\n",
      "receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far\n",
      "end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they\n",
      "content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible\n",
      "movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known\n",
      "and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for\n",
      "amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked\n",
      "himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\" he\n",
      "said, \"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is\n",
      "something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties,\n",
      "so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost,\n",
      "which is really attractive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had\n",
      "imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question,\n",
      "had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father's\n",
      "fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned\n",
      "from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on\n",
      "account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came\n",
      "up to us with outstretched hand: \"Do you know, master book-lover,\" he\n",
      "asked me, \"this line of Paul Desjardins?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never\n",
      "read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is\n",
      "converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the\n",
      "most charming water-colour touch—\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even\n",
      "when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all\n",
      "black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself,\n",
      "as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\" He took a cigarette from his\n",
      "pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. \"Goodbye,\n",
      "friends!\" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for\n",
      "dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Françoise, a colonel\n",
      "with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales\n",
      "where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the\n",
      "coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing\n",
      "over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready\n",
      "in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter's craft,\n",
      "which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to\n",
      "jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and\n",
      "included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I\n",
      "would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to\n",
      "inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little\n",
      "green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the\n",
      "asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their\n",
      "heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of\n",
      "imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the\n",
      "soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world.\n",
      "I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite\n",
      "creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the\n",
      "disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern\n",
      "in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue\n",
      "evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when,\n",
      "all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played\n",
      "(lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's\n",
      "_Dream_) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic\n",
      "perfume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Françoise with\n",
      "the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her\n",
      "in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the\n",
      "world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the\n",
      "asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately\n",
      "outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers banded about\n",
      "the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And,\n",
      "meanwhile, Françoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens,\n",
      "such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad\n",
      "from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was\n",
      "serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness\n",
      "predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the\n",
      "aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so\n",
      "tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many\n",
      "virtues.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon\n",
      "our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of\n",
      "those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent\n",
      "confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Françoise, being\n",
      "without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in\n",
      "the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a\n",
      "chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Françoise,\n",
      "beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the\n",
      "ear, accompanied with shrill cries of \"Filthy creature! Filthy creature!\"\n",
      "it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less\n",
      "prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its\n",
      "appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious\n",
      "juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead\n",
      "Françoise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not\n",
      "let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and,\n",
      "gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final \"Filthy\n",
      "creature!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have\n",
      "prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Françoise. But who would have\n",
      "baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even—roasted\n",
      "me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to\n",
      "make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt Léonie knew (though I was\n",
      "still in ignorance of this) that Françoise, who, for her own daughter or\n",
      "for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a\n",
      "singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In\n",
      "spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her\n",
      "cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise\n",
      "that Françoise's kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues\n",
      "concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to\n",
      "us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling\n",
      "with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression\n",
      "and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own\n",
      "kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which\n",
      "increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from\n",
      "herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the\n",
      "misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly\n",
      "stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of\n",
      "the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid\n",
      "was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose\n",
      "and awakened Françoise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry\n",
      "was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the\n",
      "house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a\n",
      "marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the\n",
      "symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we\n",
      "would find the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent\n",
      "Françoise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out.\n",
      "An hour elapsed, and Françoise had not returned; my mother, supposing that\n",
      "she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the\n",
      "bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Françoise who, in\n",
      "her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the\n",
      "clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that\n",
      "it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At\n",
      "each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: \"Oh, oh,\n",
      "Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to\n",
      "suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto's\n",
      "Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for\n",
      "that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew,\n",
      "having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any\n",
      "other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation\n",
      "at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the\n",
      "kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed\n",
      "account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but\n",
      "ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she\n",
      "thought that we had gone out of earshot: \"Well, she need never have done\n",
      "what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant\n",
      "enough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same,\n",
      "he must have been a god-forsaken young man to go after _that_. Dear, dear,\n",

      "other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them\n",

      "allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself\n",

      "rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her\n",

      "meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of\n",
      "anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having\n",

      "knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of\n",

      "when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either\n",
      "of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the\n",
      "same way Françoise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and\n",
      "unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other\n",
      "servant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems. Many years later we\n",

      "my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass drew to an\n",

      "though we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the\n",
      "sun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the\n",

      "him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of\n",
      "another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin's face shewed\n",
      "an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with a\n",
      "subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a\n",
      "position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been\n",
      "trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid\n",
      "recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin's\n",
      "hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this\n",
      "undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least\n",
      "hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the\n",
      "wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind\n",
      "suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the\n",
      "one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and\n",
      "while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid\n",
      "and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on\n",
      "his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to\n",
      "hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his\n",
      "shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most\n",
      "absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself\n",
      "to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless\n",
      "and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out\n",
      "through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred\n",
      "to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed\n",
      "to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a\n",
      "point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to\n",
      "acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of\n",
      "innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though\n",
      "conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into\n",
      "surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by\n",
      "the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like\n",
      "the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we\n",
      "reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the\n",
      "'Saint-Honoré,' and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to\n",
      "send it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us\n",
      "with the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past\n",
      "us, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of\n",
      "the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to\n",
      "speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of\n",
      "his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but,\n",
      "striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat\n",
      "restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue\n",
      "chink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of\n",
      "cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the\n",
      "border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship\n",
      "into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret\n",
      "understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally\n",
      "exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of\n",
      "affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us\n",
      "alone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon\n",

      "lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and\n",
      "then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering\n",
      "of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay,\n",

      "in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the\n",

      "the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the\n",
      "windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like\n",

      "light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain\n",
      "intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same\n",
      "charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it\n",
      "any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred\n",
      "times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned\n",
      "away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with\n",
      "renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge,\n",
      "rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its\n",
      "fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated\n",
      "the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a\n",
      "tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme\n",
      "which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced\n",
      "apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a\n",

      "rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy\n",
      "of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a\n",
      "wayfarer's when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and\n",

      "itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves\n",
      "offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers\n",
      "to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that\n",

      "different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when\n",
      "some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we\n",
      "have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of\n",
      "music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our\n",
      "ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather\n",
      "called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: \"You\n",

      "edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one's costume\n",
      "for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the\n",
      "reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to\n",
      "the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and\n",
      "more natural than any other tints, even after the child's mind has\n",
      "realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not\n",
      "been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had\n",
      "felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was\n",
      "in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the\n",

      "and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink\n",
      "hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of\n",
      "their familiarity—so exquisitely painful to myself—with her, and with\n",
      "all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never\n",
      "penetrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: \"Poor\n",
      "Swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so that\n",
      "she can be left alone with her Charlus—for that was Charlus: I recognised\n",
      "him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up in all that!\")\n",
      "the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which Gilberte's mother\n",
      "had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being\n",
      "obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior\n",
      "to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in\n",
      "me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up\n",
      "again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring\n",
      "to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her;\n",
      "I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to\n",
      "do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to\n",
      "be so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so\n",
      "as to shake my fist at her and shout, \"I think you are hideous, grotesque;\n",
      "you are utterly disgusting!\" However, I walked away, carrying with me,\n",
      "then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of\n",
      "happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws\n",
      "of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little\n",
      "girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held\n",
      "a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and\n",
      "subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name,\n",
      "like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn\n",
      "through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to\n",
      "conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any\n",
      "association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably\n",
      "fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the\n",
      "melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysées, where she lived in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Léonie,\" said my grandfather on our return, \"I wish we had had you with\n",

      "the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used\n",
      "to like so much.\" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk,\n",
      "either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope\n",
      "that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors.\n",
      "For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover,\n",
      "Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a\n",
      "time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as,\n",
      "when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still\n",
      "the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send\n",
      "down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she\n",
      "would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my\n",
      "grandfather, \"Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a\n",
      "drive as far as the gate of the park.\" And in saying this she was quite\n",
      "sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the\n",
      "mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which\n",
      "its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine\n",
      "weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her\n",
      "clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired'\n",
      "again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had\n",
      "begun in her—and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of\n",
      "us—was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in\n",
      "preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed\n",
      "wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived\n",
      "for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends\n",
      "bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year,\n",
      "cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see\n",
      "one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate\n",
      "no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that\n",
      "she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house\n",
      "any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with\n",
      "all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to\n",
      "have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced\n",
      "upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she\n",
      "was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement\n",
      "'tiring' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and\n",
      "silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours\n",
      "of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to\n",
      "go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying\n",
      "to make them speak of Mlle. Swann's parents and grandparents, who appeared\n",
      "to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me\n",
      "become almost mythological, of Swann—when I talked with my family I would\n",
      "grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it\n",
      "myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led\n",
      "naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in\n",
      "speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her\n",
      "company; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for\n",
      "instance, to believe that my grandfather's business had been in our family\n",
      "before his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt\n",
      "Léonie wished to visit was on common ground) to correct my statements, to\n",
      "say, as though in opposition to me and of his own accord: \"No, no, the\n",

      "the pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of\n",
      "that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more\n",
      "portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of\n",
      "all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused\n",
      "me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents,\n",
      "for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved\n",
      "them in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them\n",
      "there was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the\n",
      "conversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular\n",
      "seductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found\n",
      "again as soon as it was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that\n",
      "my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must\n",
      "find themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their\n",
      "turn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings,\n",

      "of their hearts.\n",

      "be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my\n",
      "head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my\n",
      "mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on\n",

      "to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches to my bosom, and (like a\n",
      "princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight of all her senseless\n",
      "jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in\n",
      "curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my\n",
      "forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my\n",

      "the wind for companion when one went the 'Méséglise way,' on that swelling\n",
      "plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its\n",

      "seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real\n",
      "existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and\n",

      "without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know\n",
      "nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl\n",
      "whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me\n",
      "herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose\n",
      "structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the\n",
      "intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe\n",
      "this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would\n",

      "does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the\n",
      "ultimate object with which one seeks a woman's company, or as the cause of\n",
      "the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does\n",

      "awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the\n",

      "first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and,\n",
      "later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the\n",

      "though we did not despise them, because they were of such great value to\n",
      "him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to\n",
      "his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even written down, but\n",
      "recorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets\n",
      "of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother\n",
      "thought, also, of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which M.\n",
      "Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing the girl happily settled, with an\n",
      "honest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and\n",
      "crushing misery that had come upon my aunts' old music-master, she was\n",

      "of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' But no sooner had she done this\n",
      "than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular\n",
      "position to her friend, with an emphasis which might well be regarded as\n",
      "importunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit\n",
      "down at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been\n",
      "indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again\n",
      "over the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as\n",
      "to indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made\n",
      "her lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which\n",
      "she treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and\n",
      "reticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had\n",
      "characterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where\n",
      "she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave them open,\" said her friend. \"I am hot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it's too dreadful! People will see us,\" Mlle. Vinteuil answered. And\n",
      "then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had\n",
      "uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other\n",
      "words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from\n",
      "prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I\n",
      "could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must\n",
      "have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful,\n",
      "when she hastily went on: \"When I say 'see us' I mean, of course, see us\n",
      "reading. It's so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you\n",
      "do some one may be overlooking you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her\n",
      "control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had\n",
      "felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And\n",
      "perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would\n",
      "kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but\n",
      "triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this\n",
      "time of night in this densely populated district!\" said her friend, with\n",
      "bitter irony. \"And what if they are?\" she went on, feeling bound to\n",
      "annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was\n",
      "repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which,\n",
      "she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. \"And what if they are?\n",
      "All the better that they should see us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and\n",
      "scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously,\n",
      "from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses\n",
      "clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of\n",
      "her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young\n",
      "woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined,\n",
      "such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her\n",
      "own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a\n",
      "strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to\n",
      "freedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself\n",
      "with: \"You're sure you aren't cold? You aren't too hot? You don't want to\n",
      "sit and read by yourself?...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening,\" she\n",
      "concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on some\n",
      "earlier occasion, by her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the sting\n",
      "of her friend's sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and ran away; and\n",
      "then they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the\n",
      "furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing\n",
      "like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted\n",
      "upon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her\n",
      "friend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on\n",
      "which the old music-master's portrait had been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil\n",
      "realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn\n",
      "to it, and so exclaimed, as if she herself had just noticed it for the\n",
      "first time: \"Oh! there's my father's picture looking at us; I can't think\n",
      "who can have put it there; I'm sure I've told them twenty times, that is\n",
      "not the proper place for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in\n",
      "apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of\n",
      "course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to daily\n",
      "profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently a\n",
      "liturgical response: \"Let him stay there. He can't trouble us any longer.\n",
      "D'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out of the house\n",
      "if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old monkey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, \"Oh, please!\"—a gentle reproach which\n",
      "testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it was prompted\n",
      "by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion (for\n",
      "that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long\n",
      "course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments), but\n",
      "rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of\n",
      "egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was\n",
      "attempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the\n",
      "smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies,\n",
      "that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and\n",
      "generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that\n",
      "criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt. But\n",
      "she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a\n",
      "woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless\n",
      "dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow\n",
      "to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother,\n",
      "feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the\n",
      "last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they\n",
      "were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her\n",
      "friend took the girl's head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow\n",
      "with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil,\n",
      "as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull\n",
      "and melancholy life of an orphan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?\" she said,\n",
      "taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil's ear something\n",
      "that I could not distinguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! You would never dare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not dare to spit on it? On that?\" shouted the friend with deliberate\n",
      "brutality.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward,\n",
      "preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the\n",
      "shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil, in\n",
      "return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on\n",
      "account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be\n",
      "present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have\n",
      "continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he\n",
      "might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that\n",
      "in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so strong and\n",
      "so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such\n",
      "completeness save in what is nowadays called a 'sadist'; it is behind the\n",
      "footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual\n",
      "country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to\n",
      "spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and\n",
      "no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for\n",
      "melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic' instinct that is\n",
      "responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least\n",
      "inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous\n",
      "cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes\n",
      "of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate\n",
      "expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety;\n",
      "the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to\n",
      "other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to\n",
      "herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle.\n",
      "Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was\n",
      "probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil, which a\n",
      "wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not\n",
      "have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would\n",
      "not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue,\n",
      "respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have\n",
      "practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in\n",
      "their profanation. 'Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are creatures so\n",
      "purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure\n",
      "appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And\n",
      "when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to\n",
      "impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for\n",
      "themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary\n",
      "illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and\n",
      "scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could\n",
      "understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised\n",
      "that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished\n",
      "to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once\n",
      "suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor\n",
      "old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really\n",
      "desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what\n",
      "remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment\n",
      "of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother's blue eyes\n",
      "which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the\n",
      "family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up\n",
      "between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a\n",
      "mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any\n",
      "way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to\n",
      "which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the\n",
      "idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather,\n",
      "that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure\n",
      "came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in\n",
      "her virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something\n",
      "diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at\n",
      "heart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave\n",
      "vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure\n",
      "of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all\n",
      "feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to\n",
      "those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed\n",
      "not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and\n",
      "cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that\n",
      "she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an\n",
      "accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that\n",
      "savage antipathy towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have\n",
      "thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one\n",
      "which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in\n",
      "herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the\n",
      "sufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the\n",

      "fourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords\n",
      "in battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of\n",

      "their names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I\n",

      "day, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I\n",
      "was going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried\n",
      "to discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical\n",
      "significance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would\n",
      "see before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid\n",
      "of talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its\n",
      "development. Sometimes I would depend upon my father's arranging\n",
      "everything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who\n",
      "'really counted,' that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which\n",
      "Françoise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of\n",
      "life and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the\n",
      "compulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the\n",
      "houses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the\n",
      "Minister for Mme. Sazerat's son, who had been ordered to some\n",
      "watering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time,\n",

      "wait his turn as an 'S.' If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been\n",
      "captured by brigands, convinced that my father's understanding with the\n",
      "supreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the\n",
      "Almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out\n",
      "anything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually\n",
      "threatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the\n",
      "inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance\n",
      "from bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this\n",
      "black cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of\n",
      "my future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial\n",
      "illusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father,\n",
      "who would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be\n",
      "the first writer of my day. But at other times, while my parents were\n",
      "growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my\n",
      "actual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and\n",
      "one which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be\n",
      "comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit,\n",
      "from whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was\n",
      "bound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further\n",
      "possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in\n",
      "the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die\n",
      "like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of\n",
      "those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I\n",
      "renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been\n",
      "given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the\n",
      "nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches\n",
      "that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in\n",

      "that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged\n",

      "and tradesmen. \"It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!\"\n",
      "were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with\n",
      "which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no\n",
      "resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de\n",
      "Guermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like\n",
      "the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for\n",
      "the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not\n",
      "of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that\n",
      "allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but\n",
      "which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the\n",

      "now that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself,\n",
      "acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed\n",

      "continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless\n",

      "what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and\n",

      "unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in\n",
      "that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence\n",
      "which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great\n",
      "literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these\n",

      "better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to\n",

      "ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its\n",
      "visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive,\n",
      "like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I\n",
      "used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept\n",
      "them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of\n",
      "something else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with\n",
      "the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that\n",
      "people had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight\n",
      "was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a\n",
      "confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago\n",

      "Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us\n",
      "to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that\n",
      "special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught\n",
      "sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was\n",
      "playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road\n",
      "seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a\n",
      "third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a\n",
      "hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance,\n",
      "appeared none the less to be standing by their side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of\n",
      "aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not\n",
      "penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay\n",
      "behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once\n",
      "to contain and to conceal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so\n",
      "little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we\n",
      "drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for\n",
      "the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the\n",
      "business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome;\n",
      "I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines,\n",
      "moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more.\n",
      "And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have\n",
      "vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and\n",
      "sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense\n",
      "of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more\n",
      "fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting\n",
      "for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again\n",
      "to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of\n",
      "which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road.\n",
      "The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely\n",
      "acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to\n",
      "fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my\n",
      "steeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though\n",
      "they had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they\n",
      "had concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had\n",
      "not existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head;\n",
      "and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled\n",
      "me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I\n",
      "could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had\n",
      "now travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught\n",
      "sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set.\n",
      "Every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then\n",

      "Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of\n",
      "Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was\n",
      "in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I\n",
      "borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite\n",
      "of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my\n",

      "Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that\n",

      "them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was\n",
      "come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the\n",
      "three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds\n",
      "perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then\n",
      "the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the\n",
      "steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting\n",
      "sun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon\n",
      "their sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was\n",
      "thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them\n",
      "when, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at\n",

      "meanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming\n",

      "away from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way,\n",
      "and, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes,\n",
      "drawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing\n",

      "tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a\n",

      "might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then,\n",
      "fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching\n",

      "Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday\n",
      "existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he\n",
      "accepts everything that we say as gospel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never dared to mention it,\" M. Verdurin had answered, \"but I've noticed\n",

      "sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending\n",
      "that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" answered the Doctor, at once\n",
      "mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's\n",
      "appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with\n",
      "Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. \"Nothing\n",
      "amuses me more than match-making,\" he confided to Cottard; \"I have been\n",
      "tremendously successful, even with women!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had\n",
      "alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived,\n",
      "however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which,\n",
      "though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He\n",
      "had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in\n",
      "the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who\n",
      "have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it\n",
      "transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the\n",
      "imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed\n",
      "from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly,\n",
      "grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a\n",
      "trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the\n",
      "movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of\n",
      "his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world\n",
      "when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being\n",
      "introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to\n",
      "whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being\n",
      "conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social deportment, so that in the\n",
      "company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and\n",
      "their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures\n",
      "with which, by their account, any of their 'bores' would have dispensed.\n",
      "He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing\n",
      "him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to\n",
      "one another (a grimace which Cottard styled \"letting 'em all come\"), Swann\n",
      "supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already\n",
      "somewhere, probably in some house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself\n",
      "very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the\n",
      "mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste,\n",
      "especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter\n",
      "for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that\n",
      "the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a\n",
      "husband would not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any\n",
      "allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the\n",
      "Doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The\n",
      "painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann\n",
      "found him very pleasant. \"Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I\n",
      "have been,\" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour,\n",
      "\"perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait\" (for which she had\n",
      "given the painter a commission). \"Take care, Master Biche,\" she reminded\n",
      "the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as\n",
      "'Master,' \"to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle.\n",
      "You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's what I've\n",
      "asked you to paint—the portrait of his smile.\" And since the phrase\n",
      "struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure\n",
      "that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use\n",
      "of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it\n",
      "again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of\n",
      "the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature\n",
      "had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in\n",
      "palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he\n",
      "belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was\n",
      "delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect\n",
      "in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age\n",
      "of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the consonants which\n",
      "he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his\n",
      "gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette,\n",
      "Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in\n",
      "fact, with emphasis on the distinction: \"M. Swann, pray let me present to\n",
      "you our friend Saniette\") but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of\n",
      "gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since\n",
      "Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him\n",
      "with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by\n",
      "Swann's next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the\n",
      "pianist's aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for\n",
      "she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing\n",
      "could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it\n",
      "always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference,\n",
      "but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely\n",
      "uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and\n",
      "pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling\n",
      "manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in\n",
      "the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had\n",
      "actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of\n",
      "continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare\n",
      "intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann\n",
      "supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation\n",
      "with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is such an excellent woman!\" he rejoined. \"I grant you that she is\n",
      "not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly\n",
      "when you are alone with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure she can,\" Swann hastened to conciliate him. \"All I meant was\n",
      "that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'\" he went on, isolating the\n",
      "epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, \"and, after all, that is\n",
      "something of a compliment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a moment,\" said M. Verdurin, \"now, this will surprise you; she\n",
      "writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is\n",
      "admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M.\n",
      "Swann?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should count myself most fortunate...\" Swann was beginning, a trifle\n",
      "pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said,\n",
      "and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the\n",
      "use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn\n",
      "word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by\n",
      "Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately\n",
      "pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what\n",
      "he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in\n",
      "current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing\n",
      "was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation,\n",
      "which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at\n",
      "that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most fortunate for France!\" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms\n",
      "with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign of\n",
      "brooding melancholy down in your corner,\" shouted Mme. Verdurin. \"You\n",
      "don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the\n",
      "stool of repentance,\" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood,\n",
      "which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in\n",
      "her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,' and\n",
      "'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she\n",
      "had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which\n",
      "her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that\n",
      "the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to\n",
      "the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers\n",
      "and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never\n",
      "successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of\n",
      "foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant\n",
      "repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible\n",
      "objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation\n",
      "of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the\n",
      "accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real\n",
      "hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which\n",
      "signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she\n",
      "was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the\n",
      "circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was\n",
      "now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'—and to the utter despair of M.\n",
      "Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his\n",
      "wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath\n",
      "in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a\n",
      "feigned but continuous hilarity—she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight\n",
      "her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a\n",
      "cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some\n",
      "indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands,\n",
      "which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at\n",
      "all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh\n",
      "which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate.\n",
      "So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship,\n",
      "scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a\n",
      "cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft\n",
      "and sob with fellow-feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light his\n",
      "pipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!\"), went and\n",
      "begged the young musician to sit down at the piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be tormented,\"\n",
      "cried Mme. Verdurin. \"I won't have him tormented.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why on earth should it bother him?\" rejoined M. Verdurin. \"I'm sure\n",
      "M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is\n",
      "going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no, not my sonata!\" she screamed, \"I don't want to be made to cry\n",
      "until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last\n",
      "time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance; you are\n",
      "all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will\n",
      "have to stay in bed, for a week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat\n",
      "down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them\n",
      "were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive\n",
      "originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the acute\n",
      "sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would attract the\n",
      "attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end\n",
      "of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as in Parliamentary\n",
      "debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next\n",
      "day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming\n",
      "that evening, and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been\n",
      "so amusingly done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, all right, then,\" said M. Verdurin, \"he can play just the _andante_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just the _andante_! How you do go on,\" cried his wife. \"As if it weren't\n",
      "'just the _andante_' that breaks every bone in my body. The 'Master' is\n",
      "really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he said 'we need\n",
      "only have the _finale_,' or 'just the overture' of the _Meistersinger_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not\n",
      "because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the\n",
      "distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the\n",
      "existence of certain neurasthenic states—but from his habit, common to\n",
      "many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as\n",
      "soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important,\n",
      "the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which\n",
      "the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache\n",
      "formed an essential factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't be ill this time, you'll find,\" he told her, seeking at the\n",
      "same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. \"And, if you\n",
      "are ill, we will cure you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you, really?\" Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour\n",
      "in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps,\n",
      "too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked\n",
      "herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all\n",
      "only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an\n",
      "invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow\n",
      "weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own\n",
      "prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are\n",
      "free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always\n",
      "ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands\n",
      "of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least\n",
      "inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a\n",
      "tabloid, set them once again upon their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying\n",
      "to Mme. Verdurin, \"I have my own little corner, haven't I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up.\n",
      "\"You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can\n",
      "make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What charming Beauvais!\" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before\n",
      "he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you appreciate my sofa,\" replied Mme. Verdurin, \"and I warn you\n",
      "that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the\n",
      "idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs,\n",
      "too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems\n",
      "in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry\n",
      "on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you\n",
      "look at them;—I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just\n",
      "look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on\n",
      "a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well\n",
      "drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design!\n",
      "Doesn't it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I\n",
      "am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of\n",
      "it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth\n",
      "with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing\n",
      "at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me\n",
      "like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my\n",
      "own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without\n",
      "feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite\n",
      "surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,\" she went on, \"are forbidden\n",

      "soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly\n",

      "After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him\n",
      "than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:\n",
      "\n",
      "The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played\n",
      "on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material\n",
      "quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a\n",
      "source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part,\n",
      "delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly\n",
      "perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of\n",
      "sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and\n",
      "breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea,\n",
      "silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given\n",
      "moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a\n",
      "name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to\n",
      "collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony—he knew not\n",
      "which—that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul,\n",
      "just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of\n",
      "evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to\n",
      "his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an\n",
      "impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely\n",
      "musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and\n",
      "irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in\n",
      "an instant, is, so to speak, an impression _sine materia_. Presumably the\n",
      "notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes,\n",
      "over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to\n",
      "trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breath or tenuity,\n",
      "stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these\n",
      "sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those\n",
      "which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to\n",
      "awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in\n",
      "its molten liquidity the _motifs_ which now and then emerge, barely\n",
      "discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by\n",
      "the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe,\n",
      "to recollect, to name; ineffable;—if our memory, like a labourer who\n",
      "toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the\n",
      "waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases,\n",
      "enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so,\n",
      "hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died\n",
      "away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript,\n",
      "summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his\n",
      "eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same\n",
      "impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able\n",
      "to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its\n",
      "notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite\n",
      "object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture,\n",
      "thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he\n",
      "had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments\n",
      "from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to\n",
      "partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he\n",
      "had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could\n",
      "initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and\n",
      "strange desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere,\n",
      "towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated.\n",
      "And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was\n",
      "prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its\n",
      "direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy,\n",
      "incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys\n",
      "unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he\n",
      "might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without\n",
      "speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less\n",
      "profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a\n",
      "man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has\n",
      "brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power\n",
      "of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her\n",
      "again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even\n",
      "her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months,\n",
      "to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation.\n",
      "He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any\n",
      "ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral\n",
      "satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally\n",
      "stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in\n",
      "that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his\n",
      "mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in\n",
      "(although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown\n",
      "also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which\n",
      "allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as\n",
      "he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better\n",
      "by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an\n",
      "invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did\n",
      "not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in\n",
      "his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal\n",
      "opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which\n",
      "had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much\n",
      "he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish,\n",
      "the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works.\n",
      "Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter\n",
      "a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but\n",
      "then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not\n",
      "altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a\n",
      "confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings,\n",
      "or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change\n",
      "in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered\n",
      "from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto\n",
      "beyond all hope, of starting to lead—and better late than never—a wholly\n",
      "different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that\n",
      "he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over\n",
      "to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among\n",
      "them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had\n",
      "ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the\n",
      "moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative\n",
      "influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the\n",
      "power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose\n",
      "work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to\n",
      "procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the\n",
      "course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had\n",
      "been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had\n",
      "either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed\n",
      "been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who\n",
      "had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his\n",
      "hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians\n",
      "whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play;\n",
      "but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing\n",
      "further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as\n",
      "he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little\n",
      "phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that\n",
      "it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them\n",
      "the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun to\n",
      "play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars,\n",
      "Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance,\n",
      "which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to\n",
      "veil the mystery of its birth—and recognised, secret, whispering,\n",
      "articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so\n",
      "peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could\n",
      "have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend's\n",
      "drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street,\n",
      "and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew\n",
      "and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents\n",
      "of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a reflection of its smile.\n",
      "But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told\n",
      "that it was the _andante_ movement of Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and\n",
      "violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as\n",
      "often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked\n",
      "him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't he charming?\" she asked Swann, \"doesn't he just understand it, his\n",
      "sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could\n",
      "be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in it except\n",
      "the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think I'm listening to\n",
      "an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an orchestra, more\n",
      "complete.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining\n",
      "each of his words as though he were making an epigram: \"You are most\n",
      "generous to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, \"Run and fetch him a\n",
      "glass of orangeade; it's well earned!\" Swann began to tell Odette how he\n",
      "had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a\n",
      "little way off, called out, \"Well! It looks to me as though some one was\n",
      "saying nice things to you, Odette!\" she replied, \"Yes, very nice,\" and he\n",
      "found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about\n",
      "this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he\n",
      "had composed the sonata;—what meaning the little phrase could have had\n",
      "for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann\n",
      "had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed,\n",
      "\"I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to confess that\n",
      "you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to know it!\"—and\n",
      "the painter had gone on with, \"Ah, yes, it's a very fine bit of work,\n",
      "isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,' something\n",
      "'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us\n",
      "artists.\"), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these\n",
      "questions, for none of them was able to reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite\n",
      "phrase, \"D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may\n",
      "as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through a\n",
      "microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don't\n",
      "waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not a habit\n",
      "of ours, that's all,\" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at\n",
      "her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as\n",
      "she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of\n",
      "ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of\n",
      "common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always\n",
      "take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of\n",
      "music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at\n",
      "home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of\n",
      "'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the\n",
      "beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of\n",
      "an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist\n",
      "starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical,\n",
      "in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in\n",
      "Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's portraits, what constituted harmony, for\n",
      "them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the\n",
      "pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the\n",
      "piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to\n",
      "which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung\n",
      "the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were\n",
      "able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and\n",
      "vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of\n",
      "painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of\n",
      "seeing the people—real, living people, who passed them in the streets)\n",
      "and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human\n",
      "shoulder was constructed, or that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily,\n",
      "purple.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor\n",
      "felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme.\n",
      "Verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil's sonata)\n",
      "like a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but\n",

Comparisons with the treatment of similar situations by James in The Golden Bowl and Virginia Woolf in Mrs. Dalloway emphasise the distinctiveness and validity of Meredith's tactic of persistent authorial presence.

The issue of what constitutes free indirect discourse is discussed, the relevance of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic accounts is assessed, and a three-tiered interpretation of its functions (including the integrative, evaluative, and referential functions) is proposed. The integrative and evaluative functions emphasize free indirect discourse as a bivocal or polyvocal mode, while the referential functions are seen to be relevant because they enable a more satisfactory conceptualization of free indirect discourse as the representation of verbal acts and preverbal or nonverbal mental acts. Free indirect discourse is therefore viewed not as report but as representation, a broader category which subsumes not only the rendition of verbal events, but nonverbal mental events as well.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"KELLY M.

These include the themes of Christian love, of man's responsibility for the sins and shortcomings of his fellowman, of loneliness, and of the duality in the structure of the world--all of which may be found in the works of Werfel. The German writer also agrees with Dostoevsky that intuition is a more dependable guide in life than logic; that truth and spiritual happiness may be attained only through suffering; and that material concerns in life must yield their place to spiritual pursuits. Virginia Woolf's poetic universe likewise reveals kinship to the ideas inherent in Dostoevsky's novels. As she herself avows in \\\"The Russian Point of View,\\\" the human soul and personality are the protagonists in her works. Her heroes ponder over God, Christ, man's place in the silent universe, immortality, love, the duality of human nature, and death. Like Dostoevsky, Miss Woolf dwells on the perils of modern culture and civilization, on the gift of infallible intuition, and on dreams and visions with their latent mysteries of cosmic proportions. Her artistic method, with her \\\"doubles,\\\" symbols, and her remarkable treatment of time, also link her to Dostoevsky and his literary technique.

Avoiding classical \\\"low-structuralist\\\" narratology with its \\\"normal case\\\" approach, the essay also proposes new ways of analyzing protean phenomena like description, free indirect discourse, and parenthetical discourse.

Recently others have considered her wholly ironic in her treatment of these characters. Neither trend does justice to Mrs. Woolf's subtle vision. If one takes Mrs. Dalloway as an example, one can see how by the dichotomy between Mrs. Dalloway's ecstasy and the objects of that ecstasy, by the parody of her style, and by analogous reflectors such as Septimus Smith, Sir William Bradshaw, Miss Kilman, and the solitary traveller, Mrs. Woolf constantly shifts the response between approval and rejection of Mrs. Dalloway. In so doing she demonstrates that neither the uncritical acceptance of the moment's sensation nor the abstract patterning of life is by itself acceptable. She leads the reader to see that life lies not in one nor the other but in the movement between sensibility and pattern, intuition and criticism.

The novel also turns absorptive processes into a distinct narrative procedure: Woolf 's free indirect discourse allows the narrator to absorb and be absorbed by the novel's extensive cast of characters.

The literary works and online presence in public discourses of writers labelled Afropolitan show that they challenge and revise the present world order in the way that Walter Mignolo and other theorists of decoloniality envisage in their concept of 'critical cosmopolitanism'. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Teju Cole, for example, implement Afropolitanism as a critical assessment of global culture that defies a reduction of the concept simply to its commercial dimension.

This analysis that aims to critically assess the novel's decentring discourse on selfhood in a political light. Focusing on the self-definition of the characters at the time of the fiction, the first section examines the discursive production of Clarissa Dalloway's diffused and connective self. The second section of this article considers the politics of memory within the production of identity in the novel, taking the Bergsonian notions of \\u00e9lan vital and open morality as a theoretical framework. The analysis of the production of selfhood in Mrs Dalloway at a synchronie (self-definition in the diegetic present time) and diachronic level (definition through memory) uncovers strong phallogocentric and conservative tensions in the novel, tensions that may have been overlooked as a result of Virginia Woolf s own progressive politics.

La primera secci\\u00f3n examina la auto-definici\\u00f3n de los personajes en el momento en que se desarrolla la acci\\u00f3n de la novela, centr\\u00e1ndose sobre todo en la producci\\u00f3n discursiva de la identidad difusa e interconectiva de Clarissa Dalloway. La segunda secci\\u00f3n considera la pol\\u00edtica de la memoria en la producci\\u00f3n de identidad en la novela, tomando como marco te\\u00f3rico los conceptos Bergsonianos de \\u00e9lan vital y moralidad abierta. Este an\\u00e1lisis sincr\\u00f3nico (auto-definici\\u00f3n en el presente) y diacr\\u00f2nico (definici\\u00f3n a trav\\u00e9s de la memoria) revela tensiones falogoc\\u00e9ntricas y conservadoras en la novela, tensiones que han podido quedar eclipsadas en la cr\\u00edtica debido a la pol\\u00edtica progresista de la escritora.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"David Spurr\"], \"datePublished\": \"2012-01-01\", \"Year\": 2012, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"chapter\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1qv5nb5.6\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/j.ctt1qv5nb5.6\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"fb3a8a22-ce69-3185-9269-eba00f7cea1d\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Architecture and Modern Literature\", \"issueNumber\": null, \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\", \"fullText\"], \"pageCount\": 22.0, \"pageEnd\": \"72\", \"pageStart\": \"50\", \"pagination\": \"50-72\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2012, \"publisher\": \"University of Michigan Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Art history\"], \"title\": \"An End to Dwelling:\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1qv5nb5.6\", \"volumeNumber\": null, \"wordCount\": 10028, \"numMatches\": 5, \"Locations in A\": [[98, 135], [212, 261], [404, 433], [48333, 48370], [52264, 52325]], \"Locations in B\": [[42194, 42231], [42325, 42374], [42469, 42498], [42714, 42749], [42840, 42901]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/j.ctt1qv5nb5.6\", \"keyphrase\": [\"dwelling\", \"bleak house\", \"architecture\", \"interior\", \"modern\", \"window\", \"proust\", \"modern literature\", \"architectural space\", \"cacciari\"], \"abstract\": \"<p>The Buster Keaton movie<em>One Week</em> (1920) is a possibly unintended but nonetheless effective allegory of a twentieth-century predicament.

Enforced immobility and coerced collectivity find expression in a recursive, subjectivist form that mimics the claustrophobic entrapments these novels describe.

Some aspects of this phenomenon, such as advances in printing methods, are well known. Others, in particular its controversial leap into the sky, have received far less attention. Though no longer seen as the home of divine portents, the sky did not become \\u201cempty space\\u201d in the modern era: it was still freighted with significance. This meant that the various attempts made by entrepreneurs from the 1880s to bring advertising to the skies were often met with hostility, even panic. In exploring these responses, this article resists depicting opponents of aerial advertising as oversensitive aesthetes or technophobes. Rather, it explores the ways in which urbanization and commercial development imbued the sky with new meanings. The sky was imagined as man\\u2019s most valuable connection to nature in an urban society, a precious but endangered part of the nation\\u2019s heritage, and an essential counterweight to consumer society. Aerial advertising therefore represented an unjustifiable commercialization of a priceless public space. The rejection of this form of advertising did not involve denying modernity, but achieving an accommodation with it.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": \"Advertising, Technology, and Modernity in Britain since 1885\"}, {\"creator\": [\"E.

This essay argues that the images that circulate not only between separate soliloquies, but also between soliloquy and interlude, traverse the boundary between objectivity and subjectivity and frame sensations, perceptions, and thoughts as physical presences in the real world. In the recurrent treatment of words as sensuous entities, moreover, the novel suggests that all practices of language and aspects of consciousness are essentially physical phenomena in the world of people, words, and waves. The Waves thus accomplishes something new and largely unrecognized in modern narrative: the language, imagery, structure, and themes collectively establish the continuity of word, narrative, and world through a non-subjective, physicalized consciousness.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"MARK SPILKA\"], \"datePublished\": \"1979-01-01\", \"Year\": 1979, \"Decade\": 1970, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23103167\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/23103167\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00111589\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"46770730\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2001211164\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"5245c099-b9c7-36c4-a375-e78cdcf59dea\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Criticism\", \"issueNumber\": \"1\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 33.0, \"pageEnd\": \"33\", \"pageStart\": \"1\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 1-33\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1979, \"publisher\": \"Wayne State University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Social Sciences\", \"Cultural Studies\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts -

Taking as a point of departure the notion of linguistic experiment as an essential element of literary modernism, this article proposes to re-evaluate the ideological implications of modernism's experimental poetics in the light of the modernist writers' engagement with translation as mode of literary composition. Drawing from contemporary translation theories, the notion of translation is developed as a self-conscious interrogation of the nature and function of communication; accordingly, it is argued that this notion informs modernist epistemology. Through an examination of representative authors and texts, the essay demonstrates that a large number of modernist writers (many of them also translators) were 'foreigners' who sought to express the articulation of alternative identities through a radically new language. Ultimately, the article explores the different ways in which translation may be used as an enlightening paradigm of thought for modernism. En t\\u00e9rminos generales el Modernismo europeo ha trascendido a la historia literaria como la subversi\\u00f3n de la tradici\\u00f3n, fundamentalmente en lo que ata\\u00f1e a la relaci\\u00f3n entre lenguaje y realidad, en el contexto social y cultural que comprende desde finales del siglo XIX hasta bien entrado el siglo XX. Tomando como punto de partida la idea de que el modernismo literario se vuelca en la experimentaci\\u00f3n con el lenguaje, el art\\u00edculo reconsidera las implicaciones ideol\\u00f3gicas de la po\\u00e9tica experimental modernista, prestando especial atenci\\u00f3n al modo en que los/las modernistas recurren a la traducci\\u00f3n como modelo de composici\\u00f3n literaria. Apoy\\u00e1ndose en perspectivas te\\u00f3ricas traductol\\u00f3gicas, el art\\u00edculo desarrolla la tesis de que la traducci\\u00f3n, en tanto que cuestiona la naturaleza y la funci\\u00f3n de la comunicaci\\u00f3n, es determinante para entender la epistemolog\\u00eda modernista. A trav\\u00e9s del an\\u00e1lisis de autores (en muchos casos tambi\\u00e9n traductores) y textos emblem\\u00e1ticos, el art\\u00edculo defiende que un gran numero de autores/as fueron sobre todo \\\"extranjeros\\\" a la b\\u00fasqueda de modos alternativos a trav\\u00e9s de los que expresar \\\"la diferencia\\\" de sus identidades. En \\u00faltimo t\\u00e9rmino, el articulo plantea una conceptualizaci\\u00f3n te\\u00f3rica sobre la traducci\\u00f3n que pueda resultar \\u00fatil como paradigma para repensar el modernismo.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Miyuki Amano\"], \"datePublished\": \"2017-10-13\", \"Year\": 2017, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/georelioghlstud.69.2.0160\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.5325/georelioghlstud.69.2.0160\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"23721901\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"679598805\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2014200355\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"4f6152bf-ff79-30e1-bc01-0eddd7ff194b\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"George Eliot - George Henry Lewes Studies\", \"issueNumber\": \"2\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 14.0, \"pageEnd\": \"173\", \"pageStart\": \"160\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 160-173\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2017, \"publisher\": \"Penn State University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Religion - Theology\", \"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"Unique Representations of Moses in the Works of Harriet Martineau, Charlotte Bront\\u00eb, and George Eliot\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/georelioghlstud.69.2.0160\", \"volumeNumber\": \"69\", \"wordCount\": 4892, \"numMatches\": 2, \"Locations in A\": [[11673, 11718], [11885, 12049]], \"Locations in B\": [[25578, 25623], [25633, 25797]], \"doi\": \"10.5325/georelioghlstud.69.2.0160\", \"keyphrase\": [\"eliots\", \"agatha\", \"martineau\", \"mosess\", \"charlotte\", \"bront\\u00eb\", \"midrash\", \"charlotte bront\\u00eb\", \"christianity\", \"choir invisible\"], \"abstract\": \"This article uses two methods to examine George Eliot's poem \\u201cThe Death of Moses,\\u201d which has not yet been fully analyzed. One is the comparative analysis of Moses represented by Eliot's contemporary writers, Harriet Martineau and Charlotte Bront\\u00eb. The other provides a consideration of how this poem relates to some other works in Eliot's corpus, for example, \\u201cAgatha,\\u201d \\u201cSelf and Life,\\u201d and \\u201cMordecai's Hebrew Verses.\\u201d These methods clarify the uniqueness of each writer's representation and give us a better understanding of Eliot's ideas and intentions in \\u201cThe Death of Moses.\\u201d Eliot creates a pathetic image of Moses, which symbolizes the weakness in the great prophet as well as the conflicting emotions caused by the inevitable experience of the human encounter with death. This poem is not only interesting as Eliot's version of midrash in the context of reworking of the bible, but it also deals with the concept of immortality, a theme that would be inherited by the later novelist Virginia Woolf. Furthermore, this poem invites us to be more sensitive to the interconnectedness of poems across authors and literary periods.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Johanna X.

This chapter explores the relationship of gender, illness and subversion in the text; while Florence uses feminine, passive suffering as a ruse for her 'unfeminine' sexual desires, Ashburnham's appropriately masculine presentation of a 'heart' caused by hard sportsmanship allows him to follow his sentimental longings. Ford's novel is not the only modernist text to make reference to heart diseases, with Woolf and Joyce also incorporating it into their novels. In Ulysses, Paddy Dignam's death of a sudden heart 'breakdown' is in keeping with the hard-drinking, aggressive masculinity of his friends in Dublin, whereas the eponymous heroine of Mrs Dalloway's recent heart trouble has left her white, frail and virginal in convalescence. In Ford's work, I argue, whereas 'true' illness remains in line with gender binaries, the appropriate presentation of fake illness disguises subversive sexual behaviour. However, the price of such manipulation and transgression in this rigidly gendered society is suicide; Florence and Edward are both victims of uncontrolled passions \\u2014 their metaphorical hearts \\u2014 rather than their physical health.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Paula Bennett\"], \"datePublished\": \"1993-01-01\", \"Year\": 1993, \"Decade\": 1990, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3174975\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00979740\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"50389259\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2003-213736\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"36a28d8c-505f-3b41-954e-8e9e27be3191\"}, {\"name\": \"local_doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/3174975\"}, {\"name\": \"journal_id\", \"value\": \"signs\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Signs\", \"issueNumber\": \"2\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigram\", \"bigram\", \"trigram\"], \"pageCount\": 25.0, \"pageEnd\": \"259\", \"pageStart\": \"235\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 235-259\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1993, \"publisher\": \"University of Chicago Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Anthropology\", \"Feminist & Women's Studies\", \"Sociology\", \"Social Sciences\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Art history\"], \"title\": \"Critical Clitoridectomy: Female Sexual Imagery and Feminist Psychoanalytic Theory\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3174975\", \"volumeNumber\": \"18\", \"wordCount\": 11433, \"numMatches\": 3, \"Locations in A\": [[54525, 54601], [60988, 61131], [61244, 61291]], \"Locations in B\": [[47741, 47817], [49247, 49390], [49403, 49450]], \"doi\": null, \"keyphrase\": null, \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Roberta Rubenstein\"], \"datePublished\": \"2008-07-01\", \"Year\": 2008, \"Decade\": 2000, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25167568\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"0022281X\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"42806252\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"00-214383\"}, {\"name\": \"local_doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/25167568\"}, {\"name\": \"journal_id\", \"value\": \"jmodelite\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Journal of Modern Literature\", \"issueNumber\": \"4\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigram\", \"bigram\", \"trigram\"], \"pageCount\": 18.0, \"pageEnd\": \"53\", \"pageStart\": \"36\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 36-53\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2008, \"publisher\": \"Indiana University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Art history\"], \"title\": \"\\\"I Meant Nothing by the Lighthouse\\\": Virginia Woolf's Poetics of Negation\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25167568\", \"volumeNumber\": \"31\", \"wordCount\": 9153, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[101070, 101118]], \"Locations in B\": [[3779, 3827]], \"doi\": null, \"keyphrase\": null, \"abstract\": \"Virginia Woolf's recurrent \\\"glooms\\\" and the experience of \\\"non-being\\\" (her terms)-the dark aspect of her lifelong struggle with bipolar mental illness-are reflected in her fiction through a distinct and recurrent negative vocabulary.

It proceeds by suspending belief that happiness is a good thing, or that happiness is what we want, as beliefs that are central to the intellectual history of happiness. The article suggests that feminist histories might offer an alternative history of happiness. It shows how happiness is what makes some things into goods (happy objects are those that are anticipated to cause happiness) and introduces the concept of conditional happiness, when one person\\u2019s happiness is made conditional upon another\\u2019s, to explore how, for some, happiness means following other people\\u2019s goods. The article considers feminist consciousness as a consciousness of unhappiness, of what is lost or is given up by following the paths of happiness. Such consciousness does not necessarily involve a form of self\\u2010consciousness but a worldly consciousness in which unhappiness disturbs the familiar. The article reflects specifically on black feminist consciousness as a consciousness of what does not get noticed when happiness provides a horizon of experience. It concludes by suggesting that feminists might want to claim the freedom to be unhappy without making unhappiness into a political cause.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Christy L.

It discusses how lesbian desire changes both spatial and temporal structures, via a consideration of the use of pearl imagery. In particular, it analyses the link between sexual, class and bodily construction in two texts: Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca (1938) and Carol Ann Duffy's poem 'Warming Her Pearls' (1987). These texts encode contrasting ideas about the lesbian body, ideas that are discursively textured by the periods in which they were written and by the relative ideological resistance of their writers. While du Maurier's novel establishes a concept of spatial and temporal enclosure, Duffy's poem creates an unconfined and unstable lesbian body-text. Within this, the pearl can be seen as a subversive device, destructuring and stretching the parameters of lesbian desire.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Paul Tolliver Brown\"], \"datePublished\": \"2015-07-01\", \"Year\": 2015, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jmodelite.38.4.20\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2979/jmodelite.38.4.20\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"0022281X\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"42806252\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"00-214383\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"e8a34a56-4b91-3f03-bde4-308d929b13e3\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Journal of Modern Literature\", \"issueNumber\": \"4\", \"language\": [\"en\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 19.0, \"pageEnd\": \"38\", \"pageStart\": \"20\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 20-38\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2015, \"publisher\": \"Indiana University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"The Spatiotemporal Topography of Virginia Woolf's <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>: Capturing Britain's Transition to a Relative Modernity\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jmodelite.38.4.20\", \"volumeNumber\": \"38\", \"wordCount\": 10169, \"numMatches\": 34, \"Locations in A\": [[2136, 2479], [2611, 2666], [2896, 3047], [26026, 26319], [27993, 28077], [28361, 28397], [28936, 28967], [28998, 29036], [29082, 29247], [29325, 29485], [32846, 32870], [32996, 33028], [33636, 33664], [46659, 47042], [47105, 47134], [47191, 47451], [47613, 47655], [47679, 47866], [122226, 122321], [122539, 122573], [125171, 125221], [125353, 125437], [125973, 126065], [126279, 126383], [141254, 141301], [180239, 180281], [181741, 181821], [232535, 232612], [232763, 232832], [233035, 233094], [233127, 233226], [233261, 233479], [233534, 233826], [234151, 234502]], \"Locations in B\": [[9243, 9586], [9631, 9686], [9703, 9853], [18995, 19288], [19644, 19725], [19744, 19780], [20193, 20224], [20237, 20275], [20293, 20458], [20474, 20634], [21493, 21517], [21529, 21561], [21578, 21606], [23578, 23961], [26842, 26871], [26917, 27177], [27196, 27238], [27247, 27436], [31717, 31812], [31823, 31857], [33053, 33103], [33142, 33226], [33317, 33409], [33427, 33531], [36009, 36056], [36462, 36504], [36870, 36950], [38352, 38429], [38448, 38519], [38535, 38594], [38627, 38726], [38745, 38963], [41159, 41439], [46436, 46839]], \"doi\": \"10.2979/jmodelite.38.4.20\", \"keyphrase\": [\"clarissa\", \"virginia woolf\", \"dalloway\", \"relativity\", \"einstein\", \"spatiotemporal topography\", \"characters\", \"septimus\", \"york harcourt\", \"airplane\"], \"abstract\": \"Virginia Woolf entangles time and topography in Mrs. Dalloway to reveal that her characters inhabit a relative London.

While they navigate an increasingly complex and commercialized environment, she locates them at specific landmarks as Big Ben and St. Margaret's chime the hour, creating a dynamic, interactive setting aligned with her characters' thoughts. Woolf styles a narrative that unfolds from a diversity of viewpoints, contrasting a Victorian period that adhered to the ideas of the Enlightenment with a modern period in which individuals experience a relationship between space and time in accord with Albert Einstein's special and general theories of relativity.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Erin Penner\"], \"datePublished\": \"2016-12-01\", \"Year\": 2016, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26444084\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"10624783\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"40892739\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"sn99-23369\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"92df3d89-978b-342b-923e-fdeb19fb1b8c\"}, {\"name\": \"local_doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/26444084\"}, {\"name\": \"journal_id\", \"value\": \"afriamerrevi\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"African American Review\", \"issueNumber\": \"4\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigram\", \"bigram\", \"trigram\"], \"pageCount\": 17.0, \"pageEnd\": \"359\", \"pageStart\": \"343\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 343-359\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2016, \"publisher\": \"Indiana State University\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"African American Studies\", \"American Studies\", \"Area Studies\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"For Those \\\"Who Could Not Bear to Look Directly at the Slaughter\\\": Morrison's \\\"Home\\\" and the Novels of Faulkner and Woolf\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26444084\", \"volumeNumber\": \"49\", \"wordCount\": 11367, \"numMatches\": 3, \"Locations in A\": [[20076, 20115], [167544, 167611], [168438, 168639]], \"Locations in B\": [[10751, 10790], [15972, 16032], [41635, 41836]], \"doi\": null, \"keyphrase\": null, \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"N.

Whereas Woolf's notions of space and time are intimately linked with the preeminent scientist's, her ideas of fluid subject-object boundaries offer a holistic conception of the world that proves far more compatible with the controversial assertions made by quantum physicists such as Bohr and Heisenberg in the early 1900s than with Einstein's adamant belief in objective realism. The author discusses how Mrs. Ramsey embodies key elements of the special and general theories of relativity at the same time as she supersedes them via her conscious connections to people and objects around her. Mrs. Ramsay's unique worldview is counterbalanced by her husband's traditional, representational logic, and dramatized through their interpersonal conflicts.

It claims that a trajectory leading to the defiguration of simile characterizes these theoretical interventions, since the privileging of metaphor as the \\\"figure of figures, the figure for figurality\\\" (Culler 1981: 189) is best served by the literalization of simile. I explore the manner in which simile is defigured through its subordination to theories of metaphor, as well as the critical and theoretical consequences of this process of defiguration for both metaphor and simile. Of central importance is the dynamic whereby the prima facie structural difference between metaphor and simile (the absence of connectives of similitude in the former, their presence in the latter) is made to bear the burden of simile's literality. The connective becomes the literal surplus which apparently devalues simile, according to the view that permeates modern rhetoric. A revisionist reading of the connective, anchored in an alternative theorization of the figurality of simile, is presented here.

Joseph O'Neill's contemporary account of the Irish Atlantic world as imagined in a displaced, wounded, post-9/11 New York rests upon the Irish island imaginary of James Joyce and particularly his A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. O'Neill shows that the very circularity within the Atlantic world represents not simply the imaged geographies of Ireland, New York, and Trinidad but that all of these locations function as a psychic Netherland and, in fact, as nether-islands. All of these locations in both Joyce's and O'Neill's works host cricket matches that reify and question respective island identities. Joyce and O'Neill specifically shape metaphors, allusions, and the critical settings of their narratives habitually in terms of the propinquity of the sea on their cricket pitches to highlight the vulnerability of the home island. Such unlikely geographic affiliations exist not simply within O'Neill's work but also reach back to a fundamental trope, evident in Joyce's writing particularly, of water (and the sea) as a dominant metaphor for history and the island as a wounded geography in Ireland's globalized imagined community.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"PHYLLIS ROSE\"], \"datePublished\": \"2003-07-01\", \"Year\": 2003, \"Decade\": 2000, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41221144\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/41221144\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00030937\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"8620ea9a-bdf2-369f-a9cb-155ca41bbd50\"}], \"isPartOf\": null, \"issueNumber\": \"3\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 6.0, \"pageEnd\": \"10\", \"pageStart\": \"5\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 5-10\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2003, \"publisher\": \"The Phi Beta Kappa Society\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Humanities\", \"Language & Literature\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"AT LARGE AND AT SMALL: Embedding Trollope\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41221144\", \"volumeNumber\": \"72\", \"wordCount\": 4425, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[226608, 226636]], \"Locations in B\": [[20994, 21022]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/41221144\", \"keyphrase\": [\"phineas\", \"trollope\", \"phineas finn\", \"novels\", \"wolfowitz\", \"victorian novels\", \"embedding\", \"phineas redux\", \"saddam husseins\", \"brentford\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Sonita Sarker\"], \"datePublished\": \"2001-07-01\", \"Year\": 2001, \"Decade\": 2000, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4316806\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/4316806\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"10400656\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"42391367\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"sn 99004657\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"b6f2dd80-f2a0-3937-974a-9212f2a744d6\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"NWSA Journal\", \"issueNumber\": \"2\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 30.0, \"pageEnd\": \"30\", \"pageStart\": \"1\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 1-30\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2001, \"publisher\": \"The Johns Hopkins University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Feminist & Women's Studies\", \"Social Sciences\"], \"tdmCategory\": null, \"title\": \"Locating a Native Englishness in Virginia Woolf's \\\"The London Scene\\\"\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4316806\", \"volumeNumber\": \"13\", \"wordCount\": 13284, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[141475, 141496]], \"Locations in B\": [[1428, 1449]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/4316806\", \"keyphrase\": null, \"abstract\": \"In the last century, British modernist studies have dealt increasingly with issues of class and gender. Yet, untill today, hardly any have scrutinized how race and nation are integral and intersecting elements in the perspectives of such prominent literary modernists as T. S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, or Virginia Woolf. This essay focuses on a set of six articles written by Woolf between 1931-1932 and titled \\\"The London Scene\\\" (1975a), in order to demonstrate how Woolf reclaims England from \\\"great men\\\" for the common (wo)man. I argue that maintaining distinctions between demos (the basis for democracy) and ethnos (the basis of ethnicity) is constitutive of English nationalism. I show how Woolf's act of reclamation is based simultaneously in an implicit racialization of the English self that was prevalent in her time. I juxtapose the views about England of contemporary political and literary figures as contrasts and comparisons to explicate how Woolf's gender and class politics is contingent upon her understanding of race that, in turn, is tied to English culture and nationhood.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Dorothy Bevis\"], \"datePublished\": \"1956-04-01\", \"Year\": 1956, \"Decade\": 1950, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/440808\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/440808\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"0041462X\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"50709693\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2002-227139\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"27efff77-9aff-3a5f-9316-6c2e616a4607\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Twentieth Century Literature\", \"issueNumber\": \"1\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 16.0, \"pageEnd\": \"20\", \"pageStart\": \"5\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 5-20\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1956, \"publisher\": \"Duke University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"The Waves: A Fusion of Symbol, Style and Thought in Virginia Woolf\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/440808\", \"volumeNumber\": \"2\", \"wordCount\": 9094, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[222839, 223112]], \"Locations in B\": [[20999, 21267]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/440808\", \"keyphrase\": [\"virginia woolf\", \"dalloway\", \"bernard\", \"woolfs\", \"percival\", \"neville\", \"ramsay\", \"jacobs room\", \"reality\", \"lighthouse\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Beth Rigel Daugherty\"], \"datePublished\": \"1998-01-01\", \"Year\": 1998, \"Decade\": 1990, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24906341\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/24906341\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"10809317\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"b4491635-8824-375f-aa85-5750f811c99d\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Woolf Studies Annual\", \"issueNumber\": null, \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 63.0, \"pageEnd\": \"185\", \"pageStart\": \"123\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 123-185\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1998, \"publisher\": \"Pace University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\", \"Linguistics - Language\"], \"title\": \"Virginia Woolf's \\\"How Should One Read a Book?\\\"\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24906341\", \"volumeNumber\": \"4\", \"wordCount\": 19926, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[133384, 133410]], \"Locations in B\": [[24978, 25004]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/24906341\", \"keyphrase\": [\"virginia woolf\", \"one read\", \"reading\", \"woolfs\", \"book daugherty\", \"woolf studies\", \"berg collection\", \"holograph\", \"hayes court\", \"lighthouse notebook\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Yaxiao Cui\"], \"datePublished\": \"2016-05-01\", \"Year\": 2016, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/style.50.2.0203\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.5325/style.50.2.0203\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00394238\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"60637260\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2014203188\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"99c07b65-fb0b-31a9-a069-f52cbb1e69eb\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Style\", \"issueNumber\": \"2\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 20.0, \"pageEnd\": \"222\", \"pageStart\": \"203\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 203-222\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2016, \"publisher\": \"Penn State University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": null, \"title\": \"Adjacency Pairs and Interactive Consciousness in Virginia Woolf's Novels\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/style.50.2.0203\", \"volumeNumber\": \"50\", \"wordCount\": 6597, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[237682, 238142]], \"Locations in B\": [[15850, 16332]], \"doi\": \"10.5325/style.50.2.0203\", \"keyphrase\": null, \"abstract\": \"This article responds to an important development in the study of the presentation of social minds by investigating Virginia Woolf's portrayal of consciousness in the light of a key conversational pattern: adjacency pairs. Woolf employs frequent shifts in point of view in her texts, the result of which is that different characters' streams of consciousness are interwoven together. This narrative design allows the text to probe into the relationship between different minds. Drawing on findings in discourse analysis, this article demonstrates that the way in which characters' viewpoints are juxtaposed resembles paired actions in conversation and that the intersubjectivity underlying the format of adjacency pairs is also mapped on the juxtaposition of different minds. It thereby argues that this sequencing format functions as an effective linguistic mechanism for rendering the social interactive quality of consciousness in Woolf's narrative.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Diane Gillespie\", \"Beth Rigel Daugherty\", \"Eileen Barrett\", \"Clare Hanson\", \"Mark Hussey\", \"James King\", \"Kathy J.

I argue that To the Lighthouse deliberately invokes this philosophical tradition not just in the character of Mr. Ramsay and his work on \\u201csubject, object, and the nature of reality,\\u201d but also in the figure of the kitchen table used to exemplify that work. As A. J. Ayer notes, the table serves as the philosopher's \\u201cfamiliar example\\u201d for considering our knowledge of the external world. In contrast to writers like Ann Banfield, however, I argue that Woolf's treatment of this example, and the problem it represents, provides a very different understanding from the one found in Russell's logical atomism. When Russell invokes the photographic in The Analysis of Mind, he does so to exemplify the empirical, objective foundation he desires for a realist epistemology. In contrast, Woolf's realism, as well as her understanding of the photographic, is based in neither the impersonal nor the empirical but, like the car in Mrs. Dalloway uniting a London street in a moment that is \\u201cin its common appeal emotional,\\u201d in the non-conceptual realm of inner emotion and experience. By contemplating a new kind of writing that would make such experience public, I argue, Woolf presents a significant critique of the epistemological project Russell represents, for in her view we ensure the world only by giving up our attempts to know it.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"A.

In this period, the social implications of aging came to be seen as particularly vexed, especially for women, who were considered social commodities. Various contexts are identified in which the obsession with gendered age emerged, including changing economic theories of accumulation and consumption, shifts in population, the emergence of gerontology as a discipline, and the evolving status of women. Examining how both high literary works and popular magazines produced at the time articulated and responded to these new attitudes, the article concludes by considering Rose Macaulay's novels, Dangerous Ages and Keeping up Appearances. These novels reveal that economic dependence and restricted life choices contribute to women's keen sense of loss over time, and that these serious psychological costs are often disguised behind what is feared and mourned as the \\\"loss\\\" of youth. Ultimately, the anxieties about aging projected by early-twentieth-century culture served to deflect women's attention from personal and professional development that began to seem within reach after World War I.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Dora Zhang\"], \"datePublished\": \"2014-01-01\", \"Year\": 2014, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24542581\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/24542581\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00286087\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"50709613\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2002-227133\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"467b7cf0-db7e-3a74-921d-0768ee103053\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"New Literary History\", \"issueNumber\": \"1\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 20.0, \"pageEnd\": \"70\", \"pageStart\": \"51\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 51-70\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2014, \"publisher\": \"The Johns Hopkins University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\", \"Philosophy - Metaphysics\", \"Philosophy - Epistemology\"], \"title\": \"Naming the Indescribable: Woolf, Russell, James, and the Limits of Description\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24542581\", \"volumeNumber\": \"45\", \"wordCount\": 9845, \"numMatches\": 3, \"Locations in A\": [[74247, 74641], [137049, 137345], [278293, 278415]], \"Locations in B\": [[34622, 35016], [37657, 37953], [41393, 41515]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/24542581\", \"keyphrase\": [\"demonstrative\", \"acquaintance\", \"russell\", \"clarissa\", \"harcourt brace\", \"brace jovanovich\", \"knowledge\", \"virginia woolf\", \"description\", \"indescribable\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"HARRY JANSEN\"], \"datePublished\": \"2015-02-01\", \"Year\": 2015, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24543075\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/24543075\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00182656\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"47075028\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2001-227189\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"300cbe92-2312-391a-98ac-f68f2aac4e36\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"History and Theory\", \"issueNumber\": \"1\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 24.0, \"pageEnd\": \"24\", \"pageStart\": \"1\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 1-24\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2015, \"publisher\": \"Wesleyan University\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"History\", \"History\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"TIME, NARRATIVE, AND FICTION: THE UNEASY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RICOEUR AND A HETEROGENEOUS TEMPORALITY\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24543075\", \"volumeNumber\": \"54\", \"wordCount\": 12951, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[12243, 12306]], \"Locations in B\": [[52171, 52234]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/24543075\", \"keyphrase\": [\"ricoeur\", \"temporality\", \"ricoeur time\", \"narrative\", \"dalloway\", \"clarissa\", \"bergson\", \"septimus\", \"magic mountain\", \"henri bergson\"], \"abstract\": \"In Time and Narrative, Paul Ricoeur confirms the relationship between time experience and how it is epitomized in a narrative by investigating historiography and fiction.

I argue that aside from being influenced by developing auditory technologies, modernist writers use sound and auditory experience to subvert traditional Enlightenment notions of self and narrative, which tend to privilege sight. While vision indicates an analytical self, distanced from the world, audition allows for a self immersed in the world. By examining the novels of Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson and James Joyce, I demonstrate how modernist writers connect their characters through shared listening, how music and nuances in voice are able to represent the ineffable and how stream of consciousness is a part of the auditory imagination. I suggest that much of the formal experimentation associated with modernism is dependent on this representation of sound and auditory experience.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"HARVENA RICHTER\"], \"datePublished\": \"1989-10-01\", \"Year\": 1989, \"Decade\": 1980, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/29532654\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/29532654\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00393827\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"60637278\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2007216124\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"a0cb7a4b-0ab8-3ee7-986f-f3f9cc1e2162\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Studies in the Novel\", \"issueNumber\": \"3\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 15.0, \"pageEnd\": \"319\", \"pageStart\": \"305\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 305-319\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1989, \"publisher\": \"Johns Hopkins University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\", \"Linguistics - Language\"], \"title\": \"THE \\\"ULYSSES\\\" CONNECTION: CLARISSA DALLOWAY'S BLOOMSDAY\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/29532654\", \"volumeNumber\": \"21\", \"wordCount\": 6712, \"numMatches\": 5, \"Locations in A\": [[1619, 1670], [22061, 22091], [22627, 22868], [113847, 113895], [128791, 128934]], \"Locations in B\": [[16590, 16641], [23740, 23770], [23774, 24015], [24075, 24123], [29371, 29515]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/29532654\", \"keyphrase\": [\"septimus\", \"dalloway\", \"clarissa\", \"ulysses\", \"virginia woolf\", \"dalloway notebook\", \"peter walsh\", \"woolfs\", \"dedalus\", \"clarissa and septimus\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Candis E.

Most people separate from-Kristeva says \\\"negate\\\"-the mother and subsequently recover her in signs, in language. Depressives, however, \\\"disavow the negation: they cancel it out, suspend it, and nostalgically fall back on the real object (the Thing) of their loss, which is just what they do not manage to lose, to which they remain painfully riveted\\\" (Kristeva, BS 43). Denying the negation blocks normative language and social development. Black Sun, then, yields significant insights into the heroine of Rhys's novel, Sasha Jansen, whose seemingly aberrant behavior and nonsensical language may now be understood as symptoms of Kristevan depression.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Brenda S.

As Kathryn Simpson has discussed, Mrs. Dalloway contemplates purchasing the novel Cranford (1851) as a gift, thus contributing to the articulation of a feminine gift economy. The scene's relevance, however, can only be understood fully when Woolf's story is read in its original periodical context.

Rather than simply eschewing all sources of authority in high modernist fashion, Austen confers authority on her narrators and on other characters (particularly her heroines): then, when a traditional, authoritative narrative has been thus constructed, Austen proceeds to play her authorities against each other and/or to show the wrongness of authority against the backdrop of fictional facts.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Jean M.

It investigates Virginia Woolf's criticism of the early cinema, photography and mechanized ways of perception, and reveals her highly ambivalent stance towards the visual, which ranges between the longing for immediacy, and the need for mediated vision. Woolf's reluctance to a positivist privileging of sight as the most noble and reliable of the senses finds its metaphorical expression in her use of windows, mirrors and frames, which provide a model for aesthetic vision and reception. As both an intertextual and intermedial project, The Hours, likewise, focuses on reception and spectatorship, in formally approaching filmic writing, and reflecting on contemporary habits of perception. In emphasizing the convergences and reciprocal interchanges between the novel and visual media, Michael Cunningham's novel to a certain extent prefigures its own filmic visualization in the construction of its opening sequence, its rendering of parallel worlds, and its prolific use of media references. Each novel's specific approach to the interaction of both sign systems involved, however, asserts that the question of visuality and the question of fictionality are closely intertwined.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Paula Derdiger\"], \"datePublished\": \"2016-04-01\", \"Year\": 2016, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26421834\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/26421834\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00267724\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"31871426\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"sn 95007071\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"ee3cb513-a97c-3077-b205-545162ce4748\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Modern Fiction Studies\", \"issueNumber\": \"1\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 17.0, \"pageEnd\": \"69\", \"pageStart\": \"53\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 53-69\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2016, \"publisher\": \"The Johns Hopkins University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Art history\", \"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"TO DRAG OUT A ROUGH POETRY\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26421834\", \"volumeNumber\": \"62\", \"wordCount\": 7275, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[2865, 2997]], \"Locations in B\": [[30249, 30451]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/26421834\", \"keyphrase\": [\"macinnes\", \"absolute beginners\", \"smithsons\", \"colin macinnes\", \"narrator\", \"architectural\", \"postwar\", \"postwar britain\", \"derdiger\", \"fiction\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Tom Liam Lynch\"], \"datePublished\": \"2015-07-01\", \"Year\": 2015, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24484439\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/24484439\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00138274\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"38966572\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2004-235660\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"9f44fb1d-51b5-3c9f-b152-e6e86cc9d325\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"The English Journal\", \"issueNumber\": \"6\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 4.0, \"pageEnd\": \"74\", \"pageStart\": \"71\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 71-74\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2015, \"publisher\": \"National Council of Teachers of English\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Education\", \"Social Sciences\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Linguistics - Applied linguistics\", \"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"Soft(a)ware in the English Classroom: Counting Characters: Quantitative Approaches to Literary Study\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24484439\", \"volumeNumber\": \"104\", \"wordCount\": 1961, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[339517, 339545]], \"Locations in B\": [[2734, 2762]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/24484439\", \"keyphrase\": [\"septimus\", \"clarissa\", \"english\", \"voyant tools\", \"teachers\", \"clarissa and peter\", \"language arts\", \"woolf uses\", \"characters\", \"characters names\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Andrea A.

Images of social decline competed for public attention with those of social elevation. Behind these images lay a series of dilemmas about how to reconcile the social and economic effects of military promotion with the claims of democracy. The shifting usage of the term `temporary gentleman' during the war reflected the changing background of those being granted commissions, and the possibilities of upward mobility produced tensions which were to persist and grow after demobilization. Government policies for ex-officers, in seeking to assist talent without perpetuating the distinctions of rank, were directly affected by such tensions. Ultimately, expectations of higher social status faded in the light of experiences which conveyed a sense of loss and decline, and ex-officers became a symbol for those who saw their pre-war social position being threatened in a less secure world. However, the ex-officer problem existed in its own right as the result of the uniquely awkward adjustments associated with being `de-officered' at the same time as being demobilized.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Angus Wrenn\"], \"datePublished\": \"2005-01-01\", \"Year\": 2005, \"Decade\": 2000, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/44871249\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/44871249\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"15694070\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"668143808\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"2734ce0d-18c4-301c-bed3-7312698f3074\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"International Ford Madox Ford Studies\", \"issueNumber\": null, \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 14.0, \"pageEnd\": \"54\", \"pageStart\": \"41\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 41-54\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2005, \"publisher\": \"Brill\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Art history\", \"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"ANGLE OF ELEVATION: SOCIAL CLASS, TRANSPORT AND PERCEPTION OF THE CITY IN \\\"THE SOUL OF LONDON\\\"\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/44871249\", \"volumeNumber\": \"4\", \"wordCount\": 6277, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[33674, 33716]], \"Locations in B\": [[31618, 31660]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/44871249\", \"keyphrase\": [\"london\", \"dalloway\", \"angus wrenn\", \"septimus\", \"ford madox\", \"clarissa\", \"transport\", \"social\", \"perception\", \"labourers\"], \"abstract\": \"The paper examines the formation of mental images of the modern city as described in The Soul of London. Much has been made of the ways in which Ford, writing in 1905, anticipates the mood conveyed in such classic modernist London texts as Eliot's The Waste Land and Woolf's Mrs Dalloway. These however did not emerge for another twenty years and come in the wake of the First World War. Ford shares with them a sense of emergence from recent psychological crisis, but the sense of violent fracture is not provided by war. Rather the mental images of the city which Ford focuses on in The Soul of London are the product of social class, and also developments in modes of transport at the turn of the twentieth century. In addition to Ford's mental and personal crisis at this date the images evoked in this work must be seen in terms of specific contemporary technological developments in the urban landscape.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Susan Jones\"], \"datePublished\": \"2005-01-01\", \"Year\": 2005, \"Decade\": 2000, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1568090\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/1568090\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"01472526\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"48483212\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"2005-237372\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"52b397d5-95b5-38a1-a96a-a10eff88081c\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Dance Chronicle\", \"issueNumber\": \"2\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 32.0, \"pageEnd\": \"200\", \"pageStart\": \"169\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 169-200\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2005, \"publisher\": \"Taylor & Francis, Ltd.\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Performing Arts\", \"Arts\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Art history\"], \"title\": \"Virginia Woolf and the Dance\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1568090\", \"volumeNumber\": \"28\", \"wordCount\": 11871, \"numMatches\": 3, \"Locations in A\": [[32106, 32157], [33195, 33376], [33485, 33664]], \"Locations in B\": [[63459, 63510], [63617, 63797], [63806, 63980]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/1568090\", \"keyphrase\": [\"woolfs\", \"virginia woolf\", \"ballet\", \"ballets russes\", \"dance chronicle\", \"diaghilev\", \"choreography\", \"russian dancers\", \"firebird\", \"spectre\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Jack F.

The presence of these animals can thus be aligned with Julia Kristeva's idea of the abject and H\\u00e9l\\u00e8ne Cixous's concept of the 'abominable' -- unstable elements of the self that are cast out in order to achieve a stable identity, keeping such elements present but at bay as the members of Bloomsbury explore aesthetic and intellectual realms.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Deborah Epstein Nord\"], \"datePublished\": \"1991-12-01\", \"Year\": 1991, \"Decade\": 1990, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2933746\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/2933746\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"08919356\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"42646618\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"sn99-23439\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"db357dd9-1979-31bd-a8a5-332056ec48a7\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Nineteenth-Century Literature\", \"issueNumber\": \"3\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 25.0, \"pageEnd\": \"375\", \"pageStart\": \"351\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 351-375\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1991, \"publisher\": \"University of California Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"The Urban Peripatetic: Spectator, Streetwalker, Woman Writer\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2933746\", \"volumeNumber\": \"46\", \"wordCount\": 10111, \"numMatches\": 2, \"Locations in A\": [[14422, 14506], [246173, 246408]], \"Locations in B\": [[59804, 59888], [60258, 60516]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/2933746\", \"keyphrase\": [\"urban peripatetic\", \"prostitute\", \"gaskell\", \"dombey\", \"tristan\", \"sexuality\", \"harmondsworth penguin\", \"nineteenth\", \"oliver twist\", \"fallen woman\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Jonathan R.

Grand\\u2019s novels\\u2019 interest in moral and political expression has led critics, early and late, to criticize Grand for moralizing. The novels themselves, however, express a similar concern, and strive to distinguish between moral expression aimed to effect positive change and moral expression aimed toward self-promotion. A public speaker on women\\u2019s issues herself, Grand portrays her feminist heroines\\u2019 airing of their beliefs as essential to their moral development. While demonstrating moral articulation as key to self-awareness, Grand\\u2019s narrators emphasize the selfless unselfconsciousness behind her heroines\\u2019 expressions of belief\\u2014an unself-consciousness that maneuvers around the risk that self-awareness might become self-regard. Narrative can pinpoint this selfless unself-consciousness, but, as Grand realizes, it can also transform it into just another instance of moralizing self-promotion on the part of the author. This essay reveals that Grand\\u2019s unorthodox narrative forms, previously assumed to be isolated experiments, serve as part of a complex rhetorical schema that allows Grand to grasp at ethical self-awareness that avoids self-absorption as she speaks out for moral and political change for women. Grand ultimately understands her authorial voice as engaged in a kind of secular prayer, in which her intended audience lies somewhere between self and other, the purpose of her expression somewhere between self-reflection and rhetorical efficacy. Training her readers to interpret a version of her heroines\\u2019 selfless unself-consciousness in themselves and others, Grand imagines an ethically self-reflective, rhetorically powerful mode of moral agency for women facing misinterpretation in the real, \\\"narratorless\\\" world.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Eric Hayot\"], \"datePublished\": \"2006-04-01\", \"Year\": 2006, \"Decade\": 2000, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41490956\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/41490956\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"15209857\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"606354510\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"59804ce0-c9f3-3bd6-9e67-c7d9fc2c7092\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Modern Chinese Literature and Culture\", \"issueNumber\": \"1\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 35.0, \"pageEnd\": \"154\", \"pageStart\": \"120\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 120-154\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2006, \"publisher\": \"Modern Chinese Literature and Culture\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Asian Studies\", \"Area Studies\", \"Social Sciences\", \"Cultural Studies\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"Bertrand Russell's Chinese Eyes\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41490956\", \"volumeNumber\": \"18\", \"wordCount\": 15240, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[27683, 28077]], \"Locations in B\": [[85200, 85595]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/41490956\", \"keyphrase\": [\"chinese\", \"modernism\", \"russells\", \"banfield\", \"chinese eyes\", \"russells chinese\", \"woolfs\", \"bloomsbury\", \"aesthetic\", \"laurence\"], \"abstract\": null, \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Kaelyn Kaoma\"], \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-01\", \"Year\": 2016, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/reseafrilite.47.2.05\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2979/reseafrilite.47.2.05\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00345210\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"42388134\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"sn99-4673\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"8911e07a-6a38-3827-8761-5510755f1b75\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Research in African Literatures\", \"issueNumber\": \"2\", \"language\": [\"en\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 18.0, \"pageEnd\": \"83\", \"pageStart\": \"66\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 66-83\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2016, \"publisher\": \"Indiana University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"African Studies\", \"Area Studies\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Social sciences - Behavioral sciences\"], \"title\": \"\\u201cFriend and Lover\\u201d: The Erotics of Female Friendship in Christians\\u00eb's <em>Unconfessed</em> and Ntshingila's <em>Shameless</em>\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/reseafrilite.47.2.05\", \"volumeNumber\": \"47\", \"wordCount\": 10243, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[61002, 61036]], \"Locations in B\": [[4986, 5020]], \"doi\": \"10.2979/reseafrilite.47.2.05\", \"keyphrase\": [\"lesbian\", \"african\", \"relationships\", \"friendships\", \"female\", \"african literatures\", \"erotic\", \"female friendships\", \"sexual\", \"shameless\"], \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT Central to both Yvette Christians\\u00eb's Unconfessed (2006) and Futhi Ntshingila's Shameless (2008) is an intimate female friendship. The depth of these intimacies is signaled by the fact that these relationships take precedence in the women's lives over their relationships with men, which are often less than fulfilling. There is physical contact and appreciation of beauty between female friends; the relationships are frequently equated to romantic or sexual partnerships, but the language of kinship is also used to express the depth of the bond. These friendships have an erotic quality that blurs their distinction from same-sex romantic relationships. Critics such as Lillian Faderman and Adrienne Rich have argued for an expansion of the definition of \\u201clesbian\\u201d to include female friendships for anti-patriarchal reasons. Christians\\u00eb and Ntshingila's representation of highly intimate connections between women thus speaks to a resistance to both masculine domination and a phallocentric approach to human relationships.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Jean Long\"], \"datePublished\": \"1997-01-01\", \"Year\": 1997, \"Decade\": 1990, \"docSubType\": null, \"docType\": \"document\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/45401857\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/45401857\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"10809317\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"e9077dbd-49fb-367f-88be-9b8bdb575570\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Woolf Studies Annual\", \"issueNumber\": null, \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 19.0, \"pageEnd\": \"94\", \"pageStart\": \"76\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 76-94\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1997, \"publisher\": \"Pace University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts -

Through a close reading and analysis of pertinent passages, the article shows how Woolf was not simply experimenting with forms, but also pushing forward in her tropes movement across borders and travel. Every character in the novel is somehow related to a foreign place. The domestic dimension of this novel, stressed for so long, is problematized to give way to a fresh view of Woolf as more transnational than appears. The article calls on recent works in anthropological and feminist criticism related to boundary crossing to throw light on Woolf's text. The study draws parallels between movement of characters in London and the rhetoric of travel indicated or subsumed in the lyricism of the text. Even in shop windows gazed at by the protagonist in the novel, global relations of power are inscribed, destabilizing the stasis of home and creating metaphoric hybridity. / \\u062a\\u0631\\u0643\\u0632 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0642\\u0627\\u0644\\u0629 \\u0639\\u0644\\u0649 \\u0648\\u0627\\u062d\\u062f\\u0629 \\u0645\\u0646 \\u0623\\u0643\\u062b\\u0631 \\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u064a\\u0627\\u062a \\u0641\\u0631\\u062c\\u064a\\u0646\\u064a\\u0627 \\u0648\\u0648\\u0644\\u0641 \\ufecf\\ufee8\\ufe8e\\ufe8b\\ufef4\\ufe94 \\ufed3\\ufef2 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u0633\\u0644\\u0648\\u0628\\u060c \\u0645\\u0633\\u0632 \\u062f\\u0627\\u0644\\u0627\\u0648\\u064a\\u060c \\u0648\\u062a\\u062e\\u062a\\u0644\\u0641 \\ufe8d\\ufedf\\ufee4\\ufed8\\ufe8e\\ufedf\\ufe94 \\ufee3\\ufeca \\ufe8d\\ufedf\\ufee4\\ufed4\\ufe8e\\ufeeb\\ufef4\\ufee2 \\ufe8d\\ufedf\\ufeb4\\ufe8e\\ufe8b\\ufea9\\ufe93 \\u062d\\u0648\\u0644 \\u0647\\u0630\\u0647 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062a\\u064a \\ufe97\\u064f\\ufe98\\ufea8\\ufeac \\u0646\\u0645\\u0648\\u0630\\u062c\\u0627\\ufe70 \\u0644\\u0644\\u062a\\u0645\\u062d\\u0648\\u0631 \\u062d\\u0648\\u0644 \\u0645\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648 \\ufe91\\ufeae\\ufef3\\ufec4\\ufe8e\\ufee7\\ufef2 \\u0648\\u063a\\u064a\\u0627\\u0628 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0631\\u063a\\u0628\\u0629 \\u0641\\u064a \\u0627\\u0644\\u0633\\u0641\\u0631 \\u0628\\u0639\\u064a\\u062f\\u0627\\ufe70 \\ufeed\\ufe8d\\ufeb3\\ufe98\\ufec4\\ufefc\\ufec9 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0660 \\u0648\\u0639\\u0628\\u0631 \\u0642\\u0631\\u0627\\u0621\\u0629 \\ufee3\\ufe98\\ufee4\\ufecc\\ufee8\\ufe94 \\u0641\\u064a \\u0645\\u0642\\u0627\\u0637\\u0639 \\u0645\\u0646 \\u0647\\u0630\\u0647 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0648\\u0623\\u0633\\u0644\\u0648\\u0628\\u0647\\u0627 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0633\\u0631\\u062f\\u064a \\ufe8d\\ufedf\\ufed0\\ufee8\\ufe8e\\ufe8b\\ufef4\\ufe94\\u060c \\u062a\\u0648\\u0636\\u062d \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0642\\u0627\\u0644\\u0629 \\u0623\\u0646 \\u0648\\u0648\\u0644\\u0641 \\u0644\\u064a\\u0633\\u062a \\u0623\\u062f\\u064a\\u0628\\u0629 \\u062a\\u062c\\u0631\\u064a\\u0628\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0645\\u0647\\u062a\\u0645\\u0629 \\u0628\\u0627\\u0644\\u0634\\u0643\\u0644 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\ufe8b\\ufef2 \\u0648\\u062a\\u0637\\u0648\\u064a\\u0631\\u0629 \\u0641\\u062d\\u0633\\u0628 -

Although he had not actually departed from the world, it was true that by this time the venerable \\\"Dean\\\"was at a low ebb. While younger authors were taking the novel in directions about which he was, at the least, ambivalent, Howells was aware that his own best work was behind him. Yet, throughout his career, he maintained a desire to test different literary approaches. In England in 1904, Howells tested a conceit that would allow him to keep pace with the literary movements of the day. This consisted of an extended photographic metaphor: an association of himself with the Kodak camera. He used this figuration to move beyond the philosophical foundations of his previous work. Criticism has largely overlooked this endeavor, which Howells buried away in the somewhat obscure travelogue London Films (1905). This essay shows how London Films used its photographic metaphor to question positivistic observational assumptions, the way in which this was a response to William James's Essays in Radical Empiricism (1912), and, finally, why Howells ultimately went back on his attempt to create a Kodak school in fiction.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"Ann-Marie Priest\"], \"datePublished\": \"2003-01-01\", \"Year\": 2003, \"Decade\": 2000, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3831895\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"0022281X\"}, {\"name\": \"oclc\", \"value\": \"42806252\"}, {\"name\": \"lccn\", \"value\": \"00-214383\"}, {\"name\": \"local_doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/3831895\"}, {\"name\": \"journal_id\", \"value\": \"jmodelite\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Journal of Modern Literature\", \"issueNumber\": \"2\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigram\", \"bigram\", \"trigram\"], \"pageCount\": 15.0, \"pageEnd\": \"80\", \"pageStart\": \"66\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 66-80\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2003, \"publisher\": \"Indiana University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts -

Against readings that take up other \\\"French feminists\\\" such as Irigaray to interpret Virginia Woolf's work, this article explores Kristeva's theory through a reading of The Waves. It argues that the characters in Woolf's book adhere to Kristeva's discussion of the gendering of relations to language, and, in particular, each of the three female characters can be understood as following one of the patterns of psychic identification as Kristeva describes them.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"William Baker\", \"Kenneth Womack\"], \"datePublished\": \"1998-12-01\", \"Year\": 1998, \"Decade\": 1990, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/42946457\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/42946457\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"00394238\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"59992240-9e67-32a2-8272-a67484d85a87\"}], \"isPartOf\": null, \"issueNumber\": \"4\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 145.0, \"pageEnd\": \"679\", \"pageStart\": \"535\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 535-679\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 1998, \"publisher\": \"Penn State University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Humanities\", \"Language & Literature\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"Recent Work in Critical Theory\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/42946457\", \"volumeNumber\": \"32\", \"wordCount\": 55865, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[141475, 141496]], \"Locations in B\": [[235985, 236006]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/42946457\", \"keyphrase\": [\"kenneth womack\", \"literary\", \"critical theory\", \"selections include\", \"literature\", \"seamus heaney\", \"william baker\", \"shakespeare\", \"writers\", \"devotes particular\"], \"abstract\": \"Four hundred ninety-three recently published monographs treat critical theory: specifically semiotics, narratology, rhetoric, and language systems; postmodernist criticism and deconstruction; reader-response and phenomenological criticism; feminist and gender studies; psychoanalytic criticism; and cultural and historical criticism.\", \"placeOfPublication\": null, \"subTitle\": null}, {\"creator\": [\"John Hughes\"], \"datePublished\": \"2013-01-01\", \"Year\": 2013, \"Decade\": 2010, \"docSubType\": \"research-article\", \"docType\": \"article\", \"id\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/45331711\", \"identifier\": [{\"name\": \"doi\", \"value\": \"10.2307/45331711\"}, {\"name\": \"issn\", \"value\": \"17502241\"}, {\"name\": \"local_uuid\", \"value\": \"a05f22e7-426f-31fd-a40e-b55d4de82f60\"}], \"isPartOf\": \"Deleuze Studies\", \"issueNumber\": \"4\", \"language\": [\"eng\"], \"outputFormat\": [\"unigrams\", \"bigrams\", \"trigrams\"], \"pageCount\": 19.0, \"pageEnd\": \"514\", \"pageStart\": \"496\", \"pagination\": \"pp. 496-514\", \"provider\": \"jstor\", \"publicationYear\": 2013, \"publisher\": \"Edinburgh University Press\", \"sourceCategory\": [\"Language & Literature\", \"Humanities\"], \"tdmCategory\": [\"Arts - Literature\"], \"title\": \"Deleuze, Bergson and Woolf's \\\"Monday or Tuesday\\\"\", \"url\": \"http://www.jstor.org/stable/45331711\", \"volumeNumber\": \"7\", \"wordCount\": 8348, \"numMatches\": 1, \"Locations in A\": [[342706, 344122]], \"Locations in B\": [[10907, 12327]], \"doi\": \"10.2307/45331711\", \"keyphrase\": [\"woolfs\", \"deleuze\", \"bergson\", \"deleuze bergson\", \"virginia woolf\", \"woolfs writing\", \"bergsonian\", \"kew gardens\", \"deleuze gilles\", \"bergson and woolfs\"], \"abstract\": \"Deleuze's references to Woolf's work, and his work on Bergson, allow for a more far-reaching as well as more nuanced and diverse account of her correspondences with Bergson than have been noted.

The results obtained suggest that the frequency, distribution, meanings, structures, uses and pragmatic functions of English existential there-constructions may vary according to the format, the purpose, the subject matter of the text and the relationship between the writer and a hypothetical reader.
