       "'PREFACE\\nIN 1938 I began a study of the relation between the growth\\nof the reading public and the emergence of the novel in\\neighteenth-century England; and in 1947 it eventually took\\nshape as a Fellowship Dissertation for St. John\\'s College, Cambridge.\\nTwo wider problems, however, remained unresolved.\\nDefoe, Richardson and Fielding were no doubt affected by the\\nchanges in the reading public of their time; but their works are\\nsurely more profoundly conditioned by the new climate of social\\nand moral experience which they and their eighteenth-century\\nreaders shared. Nor could one say much about how this was\\nconnected with the emergence of the new literary form without\\ndeciding what the Novel\\'s distinctive literary features were and\\nare.\\nThese are the problems with which I am here concerned, and\\nthey are so large that their treatment is necessarily selective. I\\nhave not, for example, made more than incidental reference to\\nthe earlier traditions of fiction, nor to the more immediate precursors\\nand contemporaries of my central figures; equally\\nregrettably, my treatment of Fielding is briefer than that of\\nDefoe and Richardson -- since most of the new elements of the\\nnovel had by then appeared, there seemed no need to go beyond\\nan analysis of how he combined them with the classical literary\\ntradition. Finally, although my main effort has been to elucidate\\n3\\nin a fairly systematic fashion the enduring connections between\\nthe distinctive literary qualities of the novel and those of the\\nsociety in which it began and flourished, I have not limited\\nmyself to such considerations: partly because I also wanted to\\ngive a general critical assessment of Defoe, Richardson and\\nFielding; and partly because my studies had confronted me\\nwith the monitory example of how that rigorously systematic\\nthinker Walter Shandy would \\'twist and torture everything in\\nnature to support his hypothesis\\'.\\nI am obliged to William Kimber and Co. for permission to\\nquote an extract from Peter Quennell\\'s Mayhew\\'s London; also\\nto the editors and publishers of the Review of English Studies and\\nof Essays in Criticism for allowing me to use, especially in\\nchapters I, III and VIII, material which originally appeared\\n-7-\\nin their pages. I gladly acknowledge the skill and devotion which\\nCecilia Scurfield and Elizabeth Walser exhibited both as typists\\nand cryptographers; and I am deeply grateful for the financial\\nand other assistance which I have received as Scholar, research\\nstudent and Fellow of St. John\\'s College, Cambridge, and as\\nholder of Fellowships from the Commonwealth Fund of New\\nYork and from the President of the University of California.\\nMost of my scholarly obligations are, I hope, adequately\\ndetailed in footnotes: but I must here acknowledge the great\\nstimulus I received at the outset of my research from Q. D.\\nLeavis\\'s Fiction and the Reading Public. My other debts are\\nextensive.\\nMrs. A. D. M. de Navarro, Eric Trist and Hugh Sykes\\nDavies early interested themselves in my work; I am very grateful\\nto them, and to the many scholars in diverse fields of interest\\nwho later read and criticised the various drafts which led to this\\nbook -- Miss M. G. Lloyd Thomas, Miss Hortense Powdermaker,\\nTheodore Adorno, Louis B. Wright, Henry Nash Smith,\\nLeonard Broom, Bertrand H. Bronson, Alan D. McKillop, Ivor\\nRichards, Talcott Parsons, Peter Laslett, Hrothgar Habakkuk\\nand John H. Raleigh. I owe much to them, and also to those\\nwho in a more official but equally friendly capacity directed\\nmy studies at variotis times and places: to Louis Cazamian and\\nthe late F. T. Blanchard, with both of whom I worked only\\ntoo briefly; and especially to John Butt, Edward Hooker and\\nGeorge Sherburn, whose judicious encouragement combined\\nwith unanswerable criticism have saved me from a variety of\\n4\\nill courses.\\nI. P. W.\\nUniversiy of California,\\nBerkeley.\\nFebruary 1956\\n-8-\\nCHAPTER I\\nRealism and the Novel Form\\nTHERE are still no wholly satisfactory answers to many of\\nthe general questions which anyone interested in the early\\neighteenth-century novelists and their works is likely to ask: Is\\nthe novel a new literary form? And if we assume, as is commonly\\ndone, that it is, and that it was begun by Defoe, Richardson and\\nFielding, how does it differ from the prose fiction of the past,\\nfrom that of Greece, for example, or that of the Middle Ages, or\\nof seventeenth-century France? And is there any reason why\\nthese differences appeared when and where they did?\\nSuch large questions are never easy to approach, much less\\nto answer, and they are particularly difficult in this case because\\nDefoe, Richardson and Fielding do not in the usual sense constitute\\na literary school. Indeed their works show so little sign of\\nmutual influence and are so different in nature that at first sight\\nit appears that our curiosity about the rise of the novel is unlikely\\nto find any satisfaction other than the meagre one afforded\\nby the terms \\'genius\\' and \\'accident\\', the twin faces on the Janus\\nof the dead ends of literary history. We cannot, of course, do\\nwithout them: on the other hand there is not much we can do\\nwith them. The present inquiry therefore takes another direction:\\nassuming that the appearance of our first three novelists\\nwithin a single generation was probably not sheer accident, and\\nthat their geniuses could not have created the new form unless\\nthe conditions of the time had also been favourable, it attempts\\nto discover what these favourable conditions in the literary and\\nsocial situation were, and in what ways Defoe, Richardson and\\nFielding were its beneficiaries.\\nFor this investigation our first need is a working definition of\\nthe characteristics of the novel -- a definition sufficiently narrow\\nto exclude previous types of narrative and yet broad enough to\\n5\\napply to whatever is usually put in the novel category. The\\nnovelists themselves do not help us very much here. It is true\\nthat both Richardson and Fielding saw themselves as founders\\nof a new kind of writing, and that both viewed their work as\\n-9-\\ninvolving a break with the old-fashioned romances; but neither\\nthey nor their contemporaries provide us with the kind of\\ncharacterisation of the new genre that we need; indeed they did\\nnot even canonise the changed nature of their fiction by a\\nchange in nomenclature -- our usage of the term \\'novel\\' was not\\nfully established until the end of the eighteenth century.\\nWith the help of their larger perspective the historians of the\\nnovel have been able to do much more to determine the idiosyncratic\\nfeatures of the new form. Briefly, they have seen\\n\\'realism\\' as the defining characteristic which differentiates the\\nwork of the early eighteenth-century novelists from previous\\nfiction. With their picture -- that of writers otherwise different\\nbut alike in this quality of \\'realism\\' -- one\\'s initial reservation\\nmust surely be that the term itself needs further explanation, if\\nonly because to use it without qualification as a defining characteristic\\nof the novel might otherwise carry the invidious suggestion\\nthat all previous writers and literary forms pursued the\\nunreal.\\nThe main critical associations of the term \\'realism\\' are with\\nthe French school of Realists. \\'Réalisme\\' was apparently first\\nused as an aesthetic description in 1835 to denote the \\'v?érité\\nhumaine\\' of Rembrandt as opposed to the \\'idéalité poétique\\'\\nof neo-classical painting; it was later consecrated as a specifically\\nliterary term by the foundation in 1856 of Réalisme, a journal\\nedited by Duranty. 1\\nUnfortunately much of the usefulness of the word was soon\\nlost in the bitter controversies over the \\'low\\' subjects and\\nallegedly immoral tendencies of Flaubert and his successors. As\\na result, \\'realism\\' came to be used primarily as the antonym of\\n\\'idealism\\', and this sense, which is actually a reflection of the\\nposition taken by the enemies of the French Realists, has in fact\\ncoloured much critical and historical writing about the novel.\\nThe prehistory of the form has commonly been envisaged as a\\nmatter of tracing the continuity between all earlier fiction which\\nportrayed low life: the story of the Ephesian matron is \\'realistic\\'\\nbecause it shows that sexual appetite is stronger than wifely\\nsorrow; and the fabliau or the picaresque tale are \\'realistic\\'\\n6\\nbecause economic or carnal motives are given pride of place in\\ntheir presentation of human behaviour. By the same implicit\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Bernard Weinberg, French Realism: the Critical Reaction\\n1830-1870 ( London,\\n1937), p. 114.\\n-10-\\npremise, the English eighteenth-century novelists, together with\\nFuretière, Scarron and Lesage in France, are regarded as the\\neventual climax of this tradition: the \\'realism\\' of the novels of\\nDefoe, Richardson and Fielding is closely associated with the\\nfact that Moll Flanders is a thief, Pamela a hypocrite, and Tom\\nJones a fornicator.\\nThis use of \\'realism\\', however, has the grave defect of obscuring\\nwhat is probably the most original feature of the novel form.\\nIf the novel were realistic merely because it saw life from the\\nseamy side, it would only be an inverted romance; but in fact\\nit surely attempts to portray all the varieties of human experience,\\nand not merely those suited to one particular literary\\nperspective: the novel\\'s realism does not reside in the kind of\\nlife it presents, but in the way it presents it.\\nThis, of course, is very close to the position of the French\\nRealists themselves, who asserted that if their novels tended to\\ndiffer from the more flattering pictures of humanity presented\\nby many established ethical, social, and literary codes, it was\\nmerely because they were the product of a more dispassionate\\nand scientific scrutiny of life than had ever been attempted\\nbefore. It is far from clear that this ideal of scientific objectivity\\nis desirable, and it certainly cannot be realised in practice:\\nnevertheless it is very significant that, in the first sustained effort\\nof the new genre to become critically aware of its aims and\\nmethods, the French Realists should have drawn attention to an\\nissue which the novel raises more sharply than any other literary\\nform -- the problem of the correspondence between the literary\\nwork and the reality which it imitates. This is essentially an\\nepistemological problem, and it therefore seems likely that the\\nnature of the novel\\'s realism, whether in the early eighteenth\\ncentury or later, can best be clarified by the help of those professionally\\nconcerned with the analysis of concepts, the philosophers.\\n7\\nI\\nBy a paradox that will surprise only the neophyte, the term\\nrealism\\' in philosophy is most strictly applied to a view of\\nreality diametrically opposed to that of common usage -- to the\\nview held by the scholastic Realists of the Middle Ages that it is\\nuniversals, classes or abstractions, and not the particular, concrete\\nobjects of sense-perception, which are the true \\'realities\\'.\\n-11-\\nThis, at first sight, appears unhelpful, since in the novel, more\\nthan in any other genre, general truths only exist post res; but\\nthe very unfamiliarity of the point of view of scholastic Realism\\nat least serves to draw attention to a characteristic of the\\nnovel which is analogous to the changed philosophical meaning\\nof \\'realism\\' today: the novel arose in the modern period,\\na period whose general intellectual orientation was most\\ndecisively separated from its classical and mediaeval heritage\\nby its rejection -- or at least its attempted rejection -- of universals.\\n1\\nModern realism, of course, begins from the position that truth\\ncan be discovered by the individual through his senses: it has\\nits origins in Descartes and Locke, and received its first full formulation\\nby Thomas Reid in the middle of the eighteenth century.\\n2 But the view that the external world is real, and that our\\nsenses give us a true report of it, obviously does not in itself\\nthrow much light on literary realism; since almost everyone, in\\nall ages, has in one way or another been forced to some such\\nconclusion about the external world by his own experience,\\nliterature has always been to some extent exposed to the same\\nepistemological naïveté. Further, the distinctive tenets of realist\\nepistemology, and the controversies associated with them, are\\nfor the most part much too specialised in nature to have much\\nbearing on literature. What is important to the novel in philosophical\\nrealism is much less specific; it is rather the general\\ntemper of realist thought, the methods of investigation it has\\nused, and the kinds of problems it has raised.\\nThe general temper of philosophical realism has been critical,\\nanti-traditional and innovating; its method has been the study\\nof the particulars of experience by the individual investigator,\\nwho, ideally at least, is free from the body of past assumptions\\nand traditional beliefs; and it has given a peculiar importance\\nto semantics, to the problem of the nature of the correspondence\\nbetween words and reality. All of these features of philosophical\\n8\\nrealism have analogies to distinctive features of the novel\\nform, analogies which draw attention to the characteristic\\nkind of correspondence between life and literature which\\nhas obtained in prose fiction since the novels of Defoe and\\nRichardson.\\n____________________\\n1 S ee R.

Previous literary\\nforms had reflected the general tendency of their cultures to\\nmake conformity to traditional practice the major test of truth:\\nthe plots of classical and renaissance epic, for example, were\\nbased on past history or fable, and the merits of the author\\'s\\ntreatment were judged largely according to a view of literary\\ndecorum derived from the accepted models in the genre. This\\nliterary traditionalism was first and most fully challenged by the\\nnovel, whose primary criterion was truth to individual experience-\\nindividual experience which is always unique and therefore\\nnew. The novel is thus the logical literary vehicle of a\\nculture which, in the last few centuries, has set an\\nunprecedented\\nvalue on originality, on the novel; and it is therefore well\\nnamed.\\nThis emphasis on the new accounts for some of the critical\\ndifficulties which the novel is widely agreed to present. When\\nwe judge a work in another genre, a recognition of its literary\\nmodels is often important and sometimes essential; our evaluation\\ndepends to a large extent on our analysis of the author\\'s\\n9\\nskill in handling the appropriate formal conventions. On the\\nother hand, it is surely very damaging for a novel to be in any\\nsense an imitation of another literary work: and the reason for,\\nthis seems to be that since the novelist\\'s primary task is to convey\\nthe impression of fidelity to human experience, attention to\\nany pre-established formal conventions can only endanger his\\nsuccess. What is often felt as the formlessness of the novel, as\\ncompared, say, with tragedy or the ode, probably follows from\\nthis: the poverty of the novel\\'s formal conventions would seem\\nto be the price it must pay for its realism.\\nBut the absence of formal conventions in the novel is unimportant\\ncompared to its rejection of traditional plots. Plot, of\\n-13-\\ncourse, is not a simple matter, and the degree of its originality\\nor otherwise is never easy to determine; nevertheless a broad\\nand necessarily summary comparison between the novel and\\nprevious literary forms reveals an important difference: Defoe\\nand Richardson are the first great writers in our literature who\\ndid not take their plots from mythology, history, legend or previous\\nliterature. In this they differ from Chaucer, Spenser,\\nShakespeare and Milton, for instance, who, like the writers of\\nGreece and Rome, habitually used traditional plots; and who\\ndid so, in the last analysis, because they accepted the general\\npremise of their times that, since Nature is essentially complete\\nand unchanging, its records, whether scriptural, legendary or\\nhistorical, constitute a definitive repertoire of human experience.\\nThis point of view continued to be expressed until the nineteenth\\ncentury; the opponents of Balzac, for example, used it to\\nderide his preoccupation with contemporary and, in their view,\\nephemeral reality. But at the same time, from the Renaissance\\nonwards, there was a growing tendency for individual experience\\nto replace collective tradition as the ultimate arbiter of\\nreality; and this transition would seem to constitute an important\\npart of the general cultural background of the rise of the\\nnovel.\\nIt is significant that the trend in favour of originality found\\nits first powerful expression in England, and in the eighteenth\\ncentury; the very word \\'original\\' took on its modern meaning\\nat this time, by a semantic reversal which is a parallel to the\\nchange in the meaning of \\'realism\\'. We have seen that, from\\nthe mediaeval belief in the reality of universals, \\'realism\\' had\\ncome to denote a belief in the individual apprehension of reality\\n11\\nthrough the senses: similarly the term \\'original\\' which in the\\nMiddle Ages had meant \\'having existed from the first\\' came to\\nmean \\'underived, independent, first-hand\\'; and by the time\\nthat Edward Young in his epoch-making Conjectures on Original\\nComposition ( 1759) hailed Richardson as \\'a genius as well moral\\nas original\\', 1 the word could be used as a term of praise\\nmeaning\\n\\'novel or fresh in character or style\\'.\\nThe novel\\'s use of non-traditional plots is an early and probably\\nindependent manifestation of this emphasis. When Defoe,\\n____________________\\n1 W orks ( 1773), V, 125; see also Max Scheler, Versuche zu\\neiner Soziologie des Wissens\\n( München and Leipzig, 1924), pp. 104 ff.; Elizabeth L. Mann,\\n\"The Problem of\\nOriginality in English Literary Criticism, 1750-1800\", PQ, XVIII\\n( 1939), 97-118.\\n-14-\\nfor example, began to write fiction he took little notice of the\\ndominant critical theory of the day, which still inclined towards\\nthe use of traditional plots; instead, he merely allowed his narrative\\norder to flow spontaneously from his own sense of what\\nhis protagonists might plausibly do next. In so doing Defoe\\ninitiated an important new tendency in fiction: his total subordination\\nof the plot to the pattern of the autobiographical\\nmemoir is as defiant an assertion of the primacy of individual\\nexperience in the novel as Descartes\\'s cogito ergo sum was in\\nphilosophy.\\nAfter Defoe, Richardson and Fielding in their very different\\nways continued what was to become the novel\\'s usual practice,\\nthe use of non-traditional plots, either wholly invented or based\\nin part on a contemporary incident. It cannot be claimed that\\neither of them completely achieved that interpenetration of plot,\\ncharacter and emergent moral theme which is found in the\\nhighest examples of the art of the novel. But it must be remembered\\nthat the task was not an easy one, particularly at a time\\nwhen the established literary outlet for the creative imagination\\nlay in eliciting an individual pattern and a contemporary significance\\nfrom a plot that was not itself novel.\\n(b)\\n11\\nMuch else besides the plot had to be changed in the tradition\\nof fiction before the novel could embody the individual apprehension\\nof reality as freely as the method of Descartes and Locke\\nallowed their thought to spring from the immediate facts of\\nconsciousness. To begin with, the actors in the plot and the\\nscene of their actions had to be placed in a new literary perspective:\\nthe plot had to be acted out by particular people in\\nparticular circumstances, rather than, as had been common in\\nthe past, by general human types against a background primarily\\ndetermined by the appropriate literary convention.\\nThis literary change was analogous to the rejection of universals\\nand the emphasis on particulars which characterises\\nphilosophic realism. Aristotle might have agreed with Locke\\'s\\nprimary assumption, that it was the senses which \\'at first let in\\nparticular ideas, and furnish the empty cabinet\\' of the mind. 1\\nBut he would have gone on to insist that the scrutiny of particular\\ncases was of little value in itself; the proper intellectual task\\n____________________\\n1 E ssay Concerning Human Understanding ( 1690), Bk. 1, ch. 2,\\nsect, xv.\\n-15-\\nof man was to rally against the meaningless flux of sensation,\\nand achieve a knowledge of the universals which alone constituted\\nthe ultimate and immutable reality. 1 It is this generalising\\nemphasis which gives most Western thought until the seventeenth\\ncentury a strong enough family resemblance to outweigh\\nall its other multifarious differences: similarly when in 1713\\nBerkeley\\'s Philonous affirmed that \\'it is an universally received\\nmaxim, that everything which exists is particular\\', 2 he was\\nstating\\nthe opposite modern tendency which in turn gives modern\\nthought since Descartes a certain unity of outlook and method.\\nHere, again, both the new trends in philosophy and the related\\nformal characteristics of the novel were contrary to the dominant\\nliterary outlook. For the critical tradition in the early eighteenth\\ncentury was still governed by the strong classical preference\\nfor the general and universal: the proper object of literature\\nremained quod semper quod ubique ab omnibus creditum est.\\nThis\\npreference was particularly pronounced in the neo-Platonist\\ntendency, which had always been strong in the romance, and\\n12\\nwhich was becoming of increasing importance in literary criticism\\nand aesthetics generally. Shaftesbury, for instance, in his\\nEssay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour ( 1709), expressed the\\ndistaste\\nof this school of thought for particularity in literature and\\nart very emphatically: \\'The variety of Nature is such, as to distinguish\\nevery thing she forms, by a peculiar original character;\\nwhich, if strictly observed, will make the subject appear unlike\\nto anything extant in the world besides. But this effect the\\ngood poet and painter seek industriously to prevent. They hate\\nminuteness, and are afraid of singulariy.\\' 1 He continued: \\'The\\nmere Face-Painter, indeed, has little in common with the Poet;\\nbut, like the mere Historian, copies what he sees, and minutely\\ntraces every feature, and odd mark\\'; and concluded confidently\\nthat \\'\\'Tis otherwise with men of invention and design\\'.\\nDespite Shaftesbury\\'s engaging finality, however, a contrary\\naesthetic tendency in favour of particularity soon began to\\nassert itself, largely as a result of the application to literary\\nproblems of the psychological approach of Hobbes and Locke.\\nLord Karnes was perhaps the most forthright early spokesman\\nof this tendency. In his Elements of Criticism ( 1762) he declared\\n3\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Posterior Analytics, Bk. I, ch. 24; Bk. II, ch. 19.\\n1 S ee Posterior Analytics, Bk. I, ch. 24; Bk.

Richardson\\'s first biographer,\\nindeed, Mrs. Barbauld, described his genius in terms of an\\nanalogy which has continually figured in the controversy\\nbetween neo-classical generality and realistic particularity. Sir\\nJoshua Reynolds, for example, expressed his neo-classical orthodoxy\\nby preferring the \\'great and general ideas\\' of Italian\\npainting to the \\'literal truth and... minute exactness in the\\ndetail of nature modified by accident\\' of the Dutch school; 2\\nwhereas the French Realists, it will be remembered, had followed\\nthe \\'vérité humaine\\' of Rembrandt, rather than the\\n\\'idéalité poétique\\' of the classical school. Mrs. Barbauld accurately\\nindicated Richardson\\'s position in this conflict when she\\nwrote that he had \\'the accuracy of finish of a Dutch painter\\n. . . content to produce effects by the patient labour of minuteness\\'.\\n3 Both he and Defoe, in fact, were heedless of Shaftesbury\\'s\\nscorn, and like Rembrandt were content to be \\'mere\\nface-painters and historians\\'.\\nThe concept of realistic particularity in literature is itself\\nsomewhat too general to be capable of concrete demonstration:\\nfor such demonstration to be possible the relationship of realistic\\nparticularity to some specific aspects of narrative technique\\nmust first be established.

In England, for example, Locke,\\nBishop Butler, Berkeley, Hume and Reid all debated the issue,\\nand the controversy even reached the pages of the Spectator. 1\\nThe parallel here between the tradition of realist thought and\\nthe formal innovations of the early novelists is obvious: both\\nphilosophers and novelists paid greater attention to the particular\\nindividual than had been common before. But the great\\nattention paid in the novel to the particularisation of character\\nis itself such a large question that we will consider only one of its\\nmore manageable aspects: the way that the novelist typically\\nindicates his intention of presenting a character as a particular\\nindividual by naming him in exactly the same way as particular\\nindividuals are named in ordinary life.\\nLogically the problem of individual identity is closely related\\nto the epistemological status of proper names; for, in the words\\nof Hobbes, \\'Proper names bring to mind one thing only; universals\\nrecall any one of many\\'. 2 Proper names have exactly the\\nsame function in social life: they are the verbal expression of the\\nparticular identity of each individual person. In literature, however,\\nthis function of proper names was first fully established in\\nthe novel.\\nCharacters in previous forms of literature, of course, were\\nusually given proper names; but the kind of names actually\\nused showed that the author was not trying to establish his\\ncharacters as completely individualised entities. The precepts\\nof classical and renaissance criticism agreed with the practice\\nof their literature in preferring either historical names or type\\nnames. In either case, the names set the characters in the context\\nof a large body of expectations primarily formed from past\\n____________________\\n1 N o. 578 ( 1714).\\n2 L eviathan ( 1651), Pt. I, ch. 4.\\n15\\n-18-\\nliterature, rather than from the context of contemporary life.\\nEven in comedy, where characters were not usually historical\\nbut invented, the names were supposed to be \\'characteristic\\',\\nas Aristotle tells us, 1 and they tended to remain so until long\\nafter the rise of the novel.\\nEarlier types of prose fiction had also tended to use proper\\nnames that were characteristic, or non-particular and unrealistic\\nin some other way; names that either, like those of Rabelais,\\nSidney or Bunyan, denoted particular qualities, or like those of\\nLyly, Aphra Behn or Mrs. Manley, carried foreign, archaic or\\nliterary connotations which excluded any suggestion of real and\\ncontemporary life. The primarily literary and conventional\\norientation of these proper names was further attested by the\\nfact that there was usually only one of them-Mr. Badman or\\nEuphues; unlike people in ordinary life, the characters of fiction\\ndid not have both given name and surname.\\nThe early novelists, however, made an extremely significant\\nbreak with tradition, and named their characters in such a way\\nas to suggest that they were to be regarded as particular individuals\\nin the contemporary social environment. Defoe\\'s use of\\nproper names is casual and sometimes contradictDry; but he\\nvery rarely gives names that are conventional or fanciful -- one\\npossible exception, Roxana, is a pseudonym which is fully explained;\\nand most of the main characters such as Robinson\\nCrusoe or Moll Flanders have complete and realistic names or\\naliases. Richardson continued this practice, but was much more\\ncareful and gave all of his major characters, and even most of\\nhis minor ones, both a given name and a surname. He also faced\\na minor but not unimportant problem in novel writing, that of\\ngiving names that are subtly appropriate and suggestive, yet\\nsound like ordinary realistic ones. Thus the romance-connotations\\nof Pamela are controlled by the commonplace family name\\nof Andrews; both Clarissa Harlowe and Robert Lovelace are\\nin many ways appropriately named; and indeed nearly all\\nRichardson\\'s proper names, from Mrs. Sinclair to Sir Charles\\nGrandison, sound authentic and are yet suited to the personalities\\nof the bearers.\\nFielding, as an anonymous contemporary critic pointed out,\\nchristened his characters \\'not with fantastic high-sounding\\nNames, but such as, tho\\' they sometimes had some reference to\\n16\\n____________________\\n1 P oetics, ch. 9.\\n-19-\\nthe Character, had a more modern termination\\'. 1 Such names\\nas Heartfree, Allworthy and Square are certainly modernised\\nversions of the type name, although they are just credible; even\\nWestern or Tom Jones suggest very strongly that Fielding had\\nhis eye as much on the general type as on the particular individual.\\nThis, however, does not controvert the present argument,\\nfor it will surely be generally agreed that Fielding\\'s practice in\\nthe naming, and indeed in the whole portrayal of his characters,\\nis a departure from the usual treatment of these matters in the\\nnovel. Not, as we have seen in Richardson\\'s case, that there is\\nno place in the novel for proper names that are in some way\\nappropriate to the character concerned: but that this appropriateness\\nmust not be such as to impair the primary function of\\nthe name, which is to symbolise the fact that the character is to\\nbe regarded as though he were a particular person and not a\\ntype.\\nFielding, indeed, seems to have realised this by the time he\\ncame to write his last novel, Amelia: there his neo-classical preference\\nfor type-names finds expression only in such minor\\ncharacters as Justice Thrasher and Bondum the bailiff; and all\\nthe main characters -- the Booths, Miss Matthews, Dr. Harrison,\\nColonel James, Sergeant Atkinson, Captain Trent and Mrs.\\nBennet, for example -- have ordinary and contemporary names.\\nThere is, indeed, some evidence that Fielding, like some modern\\nnovelists, took these names somewhat at random from a printed\\nlist of contemporary persons -- all the surnames given above are\\nin the list of subscribers to the 1724 folio edition of Gilbert\\nBurnet\\'s\\nHistory of His Own Time, an edition which Fielding is\\nknown to have owned. 2\\nWhether this is so or not, it is certain that Fielding made\\nconsiderable and increasing concessions to the custom initiated\\nby Defoe and Richardson of using ordinary contemporary\\nproper names for their characters. Although this custom was not\\nalways followed by some of the later eighteenth-century novelists,\\nsuch as Smollett and Sterne, it was later established as part\\nof the tradition of the form; and, as Henry James pointed out\\nwith respect to Trollope\\'s fecund cleric Mr. Quiverful, 3 the\\n____________________\\n17\\n1 E ssay on the New Species of Writing Founded by Mr. Fielding,\\n1751, p. 18.

E. M. Forster sees the portrayal of \\'life by time\\' as the\\ndistinctive role which the novel has added to literature\\'s more\\nancient preoccupation with portraying \\'life by values\\'; 1\\nSpengler\\'s perspective for the rise of the novel is the need of\\n\\'ultrahistorical\\' modern man for a literary form capable of dealing\\nwith \\'the whole of life\\'; 2 while more recently Northrop Frye has\\nseen the \\'alliance of time and Western man\\' as the defining\\ncharacteristic of the novel compared with other genres. 3\\nWe have already considered one aspect of the importance which\\nthe novel allots the time dimension: its break with the earlier\\nliterary tradition of using timeless stories to mirror the\\nunchanging moral verities. The novel\\'s plot is also distinguished\\nfrom most previous fiction by its use of past experience as the\\ncause of present action: a causal connection operating through\\ntime replaces the reliance of earlier narratives on disguises and\\ncoincidences, and this tends to give the novel a much more\\ncohesive structure. Even more important, perhaps, is the effect\\nupon characterisation of the novel\\'s insistence on the time\\nprocess. The most obvious and extreme example of this is the\\nstream of consciousness novel which purports to present a direct\\nquotation of what occurs in the individual mind under the impact\\nof the temporal flux; but the novel in general has interested itself\\nmuch more than any other literary form in the development of its\\ncharacters in the course of time. Finally, the novel\\'s detailed\\ndepiction of the concerns of everyday life also depends upon its\\npower over the time dimension: T. H. Green pointed out that\\nmuch of man\\'s life had tended to be almost unavailable to\\nliterary representation merely as a result of its slowness; 4 the\\nnovel\\'s closeness to the texture of daily experience directly\\ndepends upon its employment of a much more minutely\\n19\\ndiscriminated time-scale than had previously been employed in\\nnarrative.\\nThe role of time in ancient, mediaeval and renaissance\\n____________________\\n1 A spects of the Novel ( London, 1949), pp. 29-31.\\n2 D ecline of the West, trans.

The\\nrestriction of the action of tragedy to twenty-four hours, for\\nexample, the celebrated unity of time, is really a denial of the\\nimportance of the temporal dimension in human life; for, in\\naccord with the classical world\\'s view of reality as subsisting in\\ntimeless universals, it implies that the truth about existence can\\nbe as fully unfolded in the space of a day as in the space of a\\nlifetime. The equally celebrated personifications of time as the\\nwinged chariot or the grim reaper reveal an essentially similar\\noutlook. They focus attention, not on the temporal flux, but on\\nthe supremely timeless fact of death; their role is to overwhelm\\nour awareness of daily life so that we shall be prepared to face\\neternity. Both these personifications, in fact, resemble the\\ndoctrine of the unity of time in that they are fundamentally\\nahistorical, and are therefore equally typical of the very minor\\nimportance accorded to the temporal dimension in most\\nliterature previous to the novel.\\nShakespeare\\'s sense of the historical past, for example, is very\\ndifferent from the modern one. Troy and Rome, the Plantagenets\\nand the Tudors, none of them are far enough back to be very\\ndifferent from the present or from each other. In this\\nShakespeare reflects the view of his age: he had been dead for\\nthirty years before the word \\'anachronism\\' first appeared in\\nEnglish, 1 and he was still very close to the mediaeval conception\\nof history by which, whatever the period, the wheel of time\\nchurns out the same eternally applicable exempla.\\nThis a-historical outlook is associated with a striking lack of\\ninterest in the minute-by-minute and day-to-day temporal\\nsetting, a lack of interest which has caused the time scheme of\\n21\\nso many plays both by Shakespeare and by most of his\\npredecessors from Aeschylus onwards, to baffle later editors and\\ncritics. The attitude to time in early fiction is very similar; the\\nsequence of events is set in a very abstract continuum of time\\nand space, and allows very little importance to time as a factor in\\nhuman relationships. Coleridge noted the \\'marvellous\\nindependence and true imaginative absence of all particular\\nspace or time in the \"Faerie Queene\" \\'; 2 and the temporal\\ndimension of Bunyan\\'s allegories or the heroic romances is\\nequally vague and unparticularised.\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Herman J.

The late seventeenth century witnessed\\nthe rise of a more objective study of history and therefore of a\\ndeeper sense of the difference between the past and the present.\\n1 At the same time Newton and Locke presented a new analysis\\nof the temporal process; 2 it became a slower and more\\nmechanical sense of duration which was minutely enough\\ndiscriminated to measure the falling of objects or the succession\\nof thoughts in the mind.\\nThese new emphases are reflected in the novels of Defoe. His\\nfiction is the first which presents us with a picture both of the\\nindividual life in its larger perspective as a historical process, and\\nin its closer view which shows the process being acted out\\nagainst the background of the most ephemeral thoughts and\\nactions. It is true that the time scales of his novels are\\nsometimes both contradictory in themselves, and inconsistent\\nwith their pretended historical setting, but the mere fact that\\nsuch objections arise is surely a tribute to the way the characters\\nare felt by the reader to be rooted in the temporal dimension.\\nWe obviously could not think of making such objections seriously\\nto Sidney Arcadia or The Pilgrim\\'s Progress; there is not enough\\nevidence of the reality of time for any sense of discrepancies to\\nbe possible. Defoe does give us such evidence. At his best, he\\nconvinces us completely that his narrative is occurring at a\\nparticular place and at a particular time, and our memory of his\\nnovels consists largely of these vividly realised moments in the\\nlives of his characters, moments which are loosely strung\\ntogether to form a convincing biographical perspective. We have\\n21\\na sense of personal identity subsisting through duration and yet\\nbeing changed by the flow of experience.\\nThis impression is much more strongly and completely realised in\\nRichardson. He was very careful to locate all his events of his\\nnarrative in an unprecedentedly detailed timescheme: the\\nsuperscription of each letter gives us the day of the week, and\\noften the time of the day; and this in turn acts as an objective\\nframework for the even greater temporal detail of the letters\\nthemselves -- we are told, for example, that Clarissa died\\n____________________\\n1 S ee G.

Richardson\\'s use of\\nthe letter form also induced in the reader a continual sense of\\nactual participation in the action which was until then\\nunparalleled in its completeness and intensity. He knew, as he\\nwrote in the \\'Preface\\' to Clarissa, that it was \\'Critical situations...\\nwith what may be called instantaneous descriptions and\\nreflections\\' that engaged the attention best; and in many scenes\\nthe pace of the narrative was slowed down by minute description\\nto something very near that of actual experience. In these\\nscenes Richardson \\'achieved for the novel what D. W. Griffith\\'s\\ntechnique of the \\'close-up\\' did for the film: added a new\\ndimension to the representation of reality.\\nFielding approached the problem of time in his novels from a\\nmore external and traditional point of view. In Shamela he\\npoured scorn on Richardson use of the present tense: \\'Mrs. Jervis\\nand I are just in bed, and the door unlocked; if my master\\nshould come -- Ods-bobs! I hear him just coming in at the door.\\nYou see I write in the present tense, as Parson William says.\\nWell, he is in bed between us...\\' 1 In Tom Jones he indicated his\\nintention of being much more selective than Richardson in his\\nhandling of the time dimension: \\'We intend... rather to pursue\\nthe method of those writers who profess to disclose the\\nrevolutions of countries, than to imitate the painful and\\nvoluminous historian, who, to preserve the regularity of his\\nseries, thinks himself obliged to fill up as much paper with the\\ndetail of months and years in which nothing remarkable\\n22\\nhappened, as he employs upon those notable eras when the\\ngreatest scenes have been transacted on the human stage\\'. 2 At\\nthe same time, however, Tom Jones introduced one interesting\\ninnovation in the fictional treatment of time. Fielding seems to\\nhave used an almanac, that symbol of the diffusion of an\\nobjective sense of time by the printing press: with slight\\nexceptions, nearly all the events of his novel are chronologically\\nconsistent, not only in relation to each other, and to the time\\nthat each stage of the journey of the various characters from the\\nWest Country to London would actually have taken, but also in\\nrelation to such external considerations as the proper phases of\\nthe moon and the time-table of the Jacobite rebellion in 1745,\\nthe supposed year of the action. 3\\n____________________\\nLetter 6.\\nBk.

Logically the individual, particular case is\\ndefined by reference to two co-ordinates, space and time.\\nPsychologically, as Coleridge pointed out, our idea of time is\\n\\'always blended with the idea of space\\'. 1 The two dimensions,\\nindeed, are for many practical purposes inseparable, as is\\nsuggested by the fact that the words \\'present\\' and \\'minute\\' can\\nrefer to either dimension; while introspection shows that we\\ncannot easily visualise any particular moment of existence\\nwithout setting it in its spatial context also.\\nPlace was traditionally almost as general and vague as time in\\ntragedy, comedy and romance.

In the picaresque novel, it is true, and in\\nBunyan, there are many passages of vivid and particularised\\nphysical description; but they are incidental and fragmentary.\\nDefoe would seem to be the first of our writers who visualised\\nthe whole of his narrative as though it occurred in an actual\\nphysical environment.

Nevertheless Tom jones\\nfeatures the first Gothic mansion in the history of the novel: 1\\nand Fielding is as careful about the topography of his action as\\nhe is about its chronology; many of the places on Tom Jones\\'s\\nroute to London are given by name, and the exact location of the\\nothers is implied by various other kinds of evidence.\\nIn general, then, although there is nothing in the\\neighteenthcentury novel which equals the opening chapters of Le\\nRouge et le noir or Le Père Goriot, chapters which at once\\nindicate the importance which Stendhal and Balzac attach to the\\nenvironment in their total picture of life, there is no doubt that\\nthe pursuit of verisimilitude led Defoe, Richardson and Fielding to\\ninitiate that power of \\'putting man wholly into his physical\\nsetting\\' which constitutes for Allen Tate the distinctive capacity of\\nthe novel form; 2 and the considerable extent to which they\\nsucceeded is not the least of the factors which differentiate them\\n24\\nfrom previous writers of fiction and which explain their\\nimportance in the tradition of the new form.\\n(f)\\nThe various technical characteristics of the novel described above\\nall seem to contribute to the furthering of an aim which the\\nnovelist shares with the philosopher -- the production of what\\npurports to be an authentic account of the actual experiences of\\nindividuals.

What is\\nperhaps the most important of them, the adaptation of prose\\nstyle to give an air of complete authenticity, is also closely\\nrelated to one of the distinctive methodological emphases of\\nphilosophical realism.\\nJust as it was the Nominalist scepticism about language\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Warren Hunting Smith, Architecture in English Fiction (\\nNew Haven, 1934), p. 65.\\n2 \" Techniques of Fiction\", in Critiques and Essays on Modern\\nFiction, 1920-1951, ed.

Words did not all stand for real\\nobjects, or did not stand for them in the same way, and\\nphilosophy was therefore faced with the problem of discovering\\ntheir rationale. Locke chapters at the end of the third Book of the\\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding are probably the most\\nimportant evidence of this trend in the seventeenth century.\\nMuch of what is said there about the proper use of words would\\nexclude the great bulk of literature, since, as Locke sadly\\ndiscovers, \\'eloquence, like the fair sex\\', involves a pleasurable\\ndeceit. 1 On the other hand, it is interesting to note that although\\nsome of the \\'abuses of language\\' which Locke specifies, such as\\nfigurative language, had been a regular feature of the romances,\\nthey are much rarer in the prose of Defoe and Richardson than in\\nthat of any previous writer of fiction.\\nThe previous stylistic tradition for fiction was not primarily\\nconcerned with the correspondence of words to things, but rather\\nwith the extrinsic beauties which could be bestowed upon\\ndescription and action by the use of rhetoric. Heliodorus\\n25\\nAethiopica had established the tradition of linguistic ornateness\\nin the Greek romances and the tradition had been continued in\\nthe Euphuism of John Lyly and Sidney, and in the elaborate\\nconceits, or \\'phébus\\', of La Calprenède and Madeleine de\\nScudéry. So even if the new writers of fiction had rejected the\\nold tradition of mixing poetry with their prose, a tradition which\\nhad been followed even in narratives as completely devoted to\\nthe portrayal of low life as Petronius Sayricon, there would still\\nhave remained a strong literary expectation that they would use\\nlanguage as a source of interest in its own right, rather than as a\\npurely referential medium.\\nIn any case, of course, the classical critical tradition in general\\nhad no use for the unadorned realistic description which such a\\nuse of language would imply. When the 9th Tatler ( 1709)\\nintroduced Swift\\'s \\'Description of the Morning\\' as a work where\\nthe author had \\'run into a way perfectly new, and described\\nthings as they happen\\', it was being ironical. The implicit\\nassumption of educated writers and critics was that an author\\'s\\nskill was shown, not in the closeness with which he made his\\n____________________\\nBk. III, ch. 10, sects. xxxiii-xxxiv.\\n-28-\\nwords correspond to their objects, but in the literary sensitivity\\nwith which his style reflected the linguistic decorum appropriate\\nto its subject. It is natural, therefore, that it is to writers outside\\nthe circle of wit that we should have to turn for our earliest\\nexamples of fictional narrative written in a prose which restricts\\nitself almost entirely to a descriptive and denotative use of\\nlanguage. Natural, too, that both Defoe and Richardson should\\nhave been attacked by many of the better educated writers of\\nthe day for their clumsy and often inaccurate way of writing.\\nTheir basically realistic intentions, of course, required something\\nvery different from the accepted modes of literary prose. It is\\ntrue that the movement towards clear and easy prose in the late\\nseventeenth century had done much to produce a mode of\\nexpression much better adapted to the realistic novel than had\\nbeen available before; while the Lockean view of language was\\nbeginning to be reflected in literary theory -- John Dennis, for\\nexample, proscribed imagery in certain circumstances on the\\nground that it was unrealistic: \\'No sort of imagery can ever be\\nthe language of grief. If a man complains in simile, I either laugh\\nor sleep.\\' 1 Nevertheless the prose norm of the Augustan period\\n26\\nremained much too literary to be the natural voice of Moll\\nFlanders or Pamela Andrews: and although the prose of Addison,\\nfor example, or Swift, is simple and direct enough, its ordered\\neconomy tends to suggest an acute summary rather than a full\\nreport of what it describes.\\nIt is therefore likely that we must regard the break which Defoe\\nand Richardson made with the accepted canons of prose style,\\nnot an incidental blemish, but rather as the price they had to pay\\nfor achieving the immediacy and closeness of the text to what is\\nbeing described. With Defoe this closeness is mainly physical,\\nwith Richardson mainly emotional, but in both we feel that the\\nwriter\\'s exclusive aim is to make the words bring his object home\\nto us in all its concrete particularity, whatever the cost in\\nrepetition or parenthesis or verbosity. Fielding, of course, did not\\nbreak with the traditions of Augustan prose style or outlook. But\\nit can be argued that this detracts from the authenticity of his\\nnarratives. Reading Tom Jones we do not imagine that we are\\neavesdropping on a new exploration of\\n____________________\\n1 P reface, The Passion of Byblis, Critical Works, ed. Hooker (\\nBaltimore, 1939-43).\\n-29-\\nreality; the prose immediately informs us that exploratory\\noperations have long since been accomplished, that we are to be\\nspared that labour, and presented instead with a sifted and\\nclarified report of the findings.\\nThere is a curious antinomy here. On the one hand, Defoe and\\nRichardson make an uncompromising application of therealist\\npoint of view in language and prose structure, and thereby forfeit\\nother literary values. On the other hand, Fielding\\'s stylistic\\nvirtues tend to interfere with his technique as a novelist, because\\na patent selectiveness of vision destroys our belief in the reality\\nof report, or at least diverts our attention from the content of the\\nreport to the skill of the reporter. There would seem to be some\\ninherent contradiction between the ancient and abiding literary\\nvalues and the distinctive narrative technique of the novel.\\nThat this may be so is suggested by a parallel with French fiction.\\nIn France, the classical critical outlook, with its emphasis on\\nelegance and concision, was not fully challenged until the coming\\nof Romanticism. It is perhaps partly for this reason that French\\nfiction from La Princesse de Clèves to Les Liaisons dangereuses\\n27\\nstands outside the main tradition of the novel. For all its\\npsychological penetration and literary skill, we feel it is too\\nstylish to be authentic. In this Madame de La Fayette and\\nChoderlos de Laclos are the polar opposites of Defoe and\\nRichardson, whose very diffuseness tends to act as a guarantee\\nof the authenticity of their report, whose prose aims exclusively\\nat what Locke defined as the proper purpose of language, \\'to\\nconvey the knowledge of things\\', 1 and whose novels as a whole\\npretend to be no more than a transcription of real life -- in\\nFlaubert\\'s words, \\'le réel écrit\\'.\\nIt would appear, then, that the function of language is much\\nmore largely referential in the novel than in other literary forms;\\nthat the genre itself works by exhaustive presentation rather\\nthan by elegant concentration. This fact would no doubt explain\\nboth why the novel is the most translatable of the genres; why\\nmany undoubtedly great novelists, from Richardson and Balzac\\nto Hardy and Dostoevsky, often write gracelessly, and sometimes\\nwith downright vulgarity; and why the novel has less need of\\nhistorical and literary commentary than other genres -- its formal\\nconvention forces it to supply its own footnotes.\\n____________________\\n1 H uman Understanding, Bk. III, ch. 10, sect. xxiii.\\n-30-\\nII\\nSo much for the main analogies between realism in philosophy\\nand literature. They are not proposed as exact; philosophy is one\\nthing and literature is another. Nor do the analogies depend in\\nany way on the presumption that the realist tradition in\\nphilosophy was a cause of the realism of the novel. That there\\nwas some influence is very likely, especially through Locke,\\nwhose thought everywhere pervades the eighteenth-century\\nclimate of opinion. But if a causal relationship of any importance\\nexists it is probably much less direct: both the philosophical and\\nthe literary innovations must be seen as parallel manifestations\\nof larger change -- that vast transformation of Western\\ncivilisation since the Renaissance which has replaced the unified\\nworld picture of the Middle Ages with another very different oneone\\nwhich presents us, essentially, with a developing but\\nunplanned aggregate of particular individuals having particular\\nexperiences at particular times and at particular places.\\nHere, however, we are concerned with a much more limited\\n28\\nconception, with the extent to which the analogy with\\nphilosophical realism helps to isolate and define the distinctive\\nnarrative mode of the novel. This, it has been suggested, is the\\nsum of literary techniques whereby the novel\\'s imitation of\\nhuman life follows the procedures adopted by philosophical\\nrealism in its attempt to ascertain and report the truth. These\\nprocedures are by no means confined to philosophy; they tend,\\nin fact, to be followed whenever the relation to reality of any\\nreport of an event is being investigated. The novel\\'s mode of\\nimitating reality may therefore be equally well summarised in\\nterms of the procedures of another group of specialists in\\nepistemology, the jury in a court of law. Their expectations, and\\nthose of the novel reader coincide in many ways: both want to\\nknow \\'all the particulars\\' of a given case -- the time and place of\\nthe occurrence; both must be satisfied as to the identities of the\\nparties concerned, and will refuse to accept evidence about\\nanyone called Sir Toby Belch or Mr. Badman -- still less about a\\nChloe who has no surname and is \\'common as the air\\'; and they\\nalso expect the witnesses to tell the story \\'in his own words\\'. The\\njury, in fact, takes the \\'circumstantial view of life\\', which T. H.\\nGreen 1 found to be the characteristic outlook of the novel.\\n____________________\\n1 \" Estimate\", Works, III, 37.\\n-31-\\nThe narrative method whereby the novel embodies this\\ncircumstantial view of life may be called its formal realism;\\nformal, because the term realism does not here refer to any\\nspecial literary doctrine or purpose, but only to a set of narrative\\nprocedures which are so commonly found together in the novel,\\nand so rarely in other literary genres, that they may be regarded\\nas typical of the form itself. Formal realism, in fact, is the\\nnarrative embodiment of a premise that Defoe and Richardson\\naccepted very literally, but which is implicit in the novel form in\\ngeneral: the premise, or primary convention, that the novel is a\\nfull and authentic report of human experience, and is therefore\\nunder an obligation to satisfy its reader with such details of the\\nstory as the individuality of the actors concerned, the particulars\\nof the times and places of their actions, details which are\\npresented through a more largely referential use of language\\nthan is common in other literary forms.\\nFormal realism is, of course, like the rules of evidence, only a\\nconvention; and there is no reason why the report on human life\\nwhich is presented by it should be in fact any truer than those\\n29\\npresented through the very different conventions of other literary\\ngenres. The novel\\'s air of total authenticity, indeed, does tend to\\nauthorise confusion on this point: and the tendency of some\\nRealists and Naturalists to forget that the accurate transcription\\nof actuality does not necessarily produce a work of any real truth\\nor enduring literary value is no doubt partly responsible for the\\nrather widespread distaste for Realism and all its works which is\\ncurrent today. This distaste, however, may also promote critical\\nconfusion by leading us into the opposite error; we must not\\nallow an awareness of certain shortcomings in the aims of the\\nRealist school to obscure the very considerable extent to which\\nthe novel in general, as much in Joyce as in Zola, employs the\\nliterary means here called formal realism. Nor must we forget\\nthat, although formal realism is only a convention, it has, like all\\nliterary conventions, its own peculiar advantages. There are\\nimportant differences in the degree to which different literary\\nforms imitate reality; and the formal realism of the novel allows\\na more immediate imitation of individual experience set in its\\ntemporal and spatial environment than do other literary forms.\\nConsequently the novel\\'s conventions make much smaller\\ndemands on the audience than do most literary conventions; and\\nthis surely explains why the\\n-32-\\nmajority of readers in the last two hundred years have found in\\nthe novel the literary form which most closely satisfies their\\nwishes for a close correspondence between life and art. Nor are\\nthe advantages of the close and detailed correspondence to real\\nlife offered by formal realism limited to assisting the novel\\'s\\npopularity; they are also related to its most distinctive literary\\nqualities, as we shall see.\\nIn the strictest sense, of course, formal realism was not\\ndiscovered by Defoe and Richardson; they only applied it much\\nmore completely than had been done before. Homer, for\\nexample, as Carlyle pointed out, 1 shared with them that\\noutstanding \\'clearness of sight\\' which is manifested in the\\n\\'detailed, ample and lovingly exact\\' descriptions that abound in\\ntheir works; and there are many passages in later fiction, from\\nThe Golden Ass to Aucassin and Nicolette, from Chaucer to\\nBunyan, where the characters, their actions and their\\nenvironment are presented with a particularity as authentic as\\nthat in any eighteenth-century novel. But there is an important\\ndifference: in Homer and in earlier prose fiction these passages\\nare relatively rare, and tend to stand out from the surrounding\\nnarrative; the total literary structure was not consistently\\n31\\noriented in the direction of formal realism, and the plot\\nespecially, which was usually traditional and often highly\\nimprobable, was in direct conflict with its premises. Even when\\nprevious writers had overtly professed a wholly realistic aim, as\\ndid many seventeenth-century writers, they did not pursue it\\nwholeheartedly. La Calprenède, Richard Head, Grimmelshausen,\\nBunyan, Aphra Behn, Furetière, 2 to mention only a few, had all\\nasserted that their fictions were literally true; but their prefatory\\nasseverations are no more convincing than the very similar ones\\nto be found in most works of mediaeval hagiography. The aim of\\nverisimilitude had not been deeply enough assimilated in either\\ncase to bring about the full rejection of all the non-realistic\\nconventions that governed the genre.\\nFor reasons to be considered in the next chapter, Defoe and\\nRichardson were unprecedentedly independent of the literary\\nconventions which might have interfered with their primary\\nintentions, and they accepted the requirements of literal truth\\n____________________\\n1 \" Burns\", Critical and Miscellaneous Essays ( New York, 1899),\\nI, 276-277.\\n2 S ee A.

Among the many\\nreasons which made it possible for that break to occur earlier\\nand more thoroughly in England than elsewhere, considerable\\nimportance must certainly be attached to changes in the\\neighteenth-century reading public. In his English Literature and\\nSociety in the Eighteenth Century, for example, Leslie Stephen\\nlong ago suggested that \\'the gradual extension of the reading\\nclass affected the development of the literature addressed to\\nthem\\', 1 and he pointed to the rise of the novel, together with\\nthat of journalism, as prime examples of the effect of changes in\\nthe audience for literature. The nature of the evidence is such,\\nhowever, that a reasonably full analysis would be inordinately\\nlong and yet fall far short of completeness in some important\\nmatters where information is scanty and difficult to interpret:\\nwhat is offered here, therefore, is only a brief and tentative\\ntreatment of a few of the possible connections between changes\\nin the nature and organisation of the reading public, and the\\nemergence of the novel.\\nI\\nMany eighteenth-century observers thought that their age was\\none of remarkable and increasing popular interest in reading. On\\nthe other hand, it is probable that although the reading public\\nwas large by comparison with previous periods, it was still very\\nfar from the mass reading public of today. The most convincing\\nevidence of this is statistical, although it must, of course, be\\nremembered that all the numerical estimates available are, to\\nvarying but always considerable degrees, both untrustworthy in\\nthemselves and problematic in their application.\\n____________________\\n1 L ondon, 1904, p. 26.

Such is certainly the implication of the most reliable\\nevidence available on the circulation of newspapers and\\nperiodicals: one figure, that of 43,800 copies sold weekly in\\n1704, 2 implies less than one newspaper buyer per hundred\\npersons per week; and another later figure, of 23,673 copies sold\\ndaily in 1753, 3 suggests that although the newspaperbuying\\npublic tripled in the first half of the century, it remained a very\\nsmall percentage of the total population. Even if we accept the\\nhighest contemporary estimate of the number of readers per\\ncopy, that of twenty made by Addison in the Spectator, 4 we are\\nleft with a maximum newspaper-reading public of less than half a\\nmillion -- at most one in eleven of the total population; and since\\nthe estimate of twenty readers per copy seems a wild (and not\\ndisinterested) exaggeration, the real proportion was probably no\\nmore than half of this, or less than one in twenty.\\nThe sale of the most popular books in the period suggests a\\nbook-buying public that is still numbered only in tens of\\nthousands. Most of the very few secular works with sales of over\\nten thousand were topical pamphlets, such as Swift\\'s Conduct of\\nthe Allies ( 1711), with a sale of 11,000 copies, 5 and Price\\'s\\nObservations on the Nature of Civil Liberty ( 1776), with a sale of\\n60,000 in a few months. 6 The highest figure recorded for a\\nsingle work, that of 105,000, for Bishop Sherlock\\'s 1750 Letter\\nfrom the Lord Bishop of London to the Clergy and People of\\nLondon on the Occasion of the Late Earthquakes..., 7 was for a\\nsomewhat sensational religious pamphlet, many of which were\\ndistributed free for evangelical purposes. Sales of full-length, and\\ntherefore more expensive, works were much smaller, especially\\nwhen they were of a secular nature.\\n____________________\\n1 C it. A. S.

In 1724 Samuel Negus, a printer,\\ncomplained that the number of printing presses in London had\\nincreased to 70; 1 but by 1757 another printer, Strahan,\\nestimated that there were between 150 and 200 \\'constantly\\nemployed\\'. 2 A modern estimate of the average annual\\npublication of new books, excluding pamphlets, suggests that an\\nalmost fourfold increase occurred during the century; annual\\noutput from 1666 to 1756 averaging less than 100, and that\\nfrom 1792 to 1802, 372. 3\\nIt is likely, therefore, that when, in 1781, Johnson spoke of a\\n\\'nation of readers\\', 4 he had in mind a situation which had to a\\nlarge extent arisen after 1750, and that, even so, his phrase\\nmust not be taken literally: the increase in the reading public\\nmay have been sufficiently marked to justify hyperbole, but it\\nwas still on a very limited scale.\\nA brief survey of the factors which affected the composition of\\nthe reading public will show why it remained so small by modern\\nstandards.\\nThe first and most obvious of these factors was the very limited\\ndistribution of literacy; not literacy in its eighteenthcentury sense\\n-- knowledge of the classical languages and literatures, especially\\nLatin -- but literacy in the modern sense of a bare capacity to\\nread and write the mother-tongue. Even this was far from\\nuniversal in eighteenth-century England. James Lackington, for\\nexample, towards the end of the century reported that \\'in giving\\naway religious tracts I found that some of the farmers and their\\nchildren, and also three-fourths of the poor could not read\\'; 5 and\\nthere is much evidence to suggest that in the country many\\nsmall farmers, their families, and the majority of labourers, were\\nquite illiterate, while even in the towns certain sections of the\\npoor -- especially soldiers, sailors and the rabble of the streets --\\ncould not read.\\n____________________\\n34\\n1 C ollins, Authorship, p. 236.\\n2 R .

In London especially: the general\\nspread of shop names instead of signs, which struck a Swiss\\nvisitor, Carl Philipp Moritz, as unusual, in 1782, 1 surely implies\\nthat it was being increasingly assumed that written\\ncommunications would be understood by a large enough\\nproportion even of the denizens of Gin Lane to be worth\\naddressing to them.\\nOpportunities for learning to read seem to have been fairly\\nwidely available, although the evidence strongly suggests that\\npopular schooling was at best casual and intermittent. An\\neducational system as such hardly existed; but a miscellaneous\\nnetwork of old endowed grammar schools and English schools,\\ncharity schools and non-endowed schools of various kinds,\\nnotably dame schools, covered the country, with the exception of\\nsome outlying rural areas and some of the new industrial towns\\nof the north. In 1788, the first year for which adequate figures\\nare available, about a quarter of the parishes of England had no\\nschool at all, and nearly a half had no endowed schools. 2 The\\ncoverage earlier in the century was probably a little, but not\\nmuch, greater.\\nAttendance at these schools was usually too short and irreglar to\\ngive the poor anything but the rudiments of reading. Children of\\nthe lower classes often left school at the age of six or seven, and\\nif they continued, it was only for a few months in the year when\\nthere was no work in the fields or the factories. The fees of 2d.\\nto 6d. a week charged at the commonest type of elementary\\nschool, the dame schools, would be a considerable drain on\\nmany incomes, and completely beyond the normal range of the\\nmillion or more persons who were regularly on poor relief\\nthroughout the century. 3 For some of these, especially in London\\nand the larger towns, Charity Schools provided free educational\\nfacilities: but their main emphasis was on religious education and\\nsocial discipline; the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic -\\n- the \\'three R\\'s\\' -- was a secondary aim and it was rarely\\n35\\npursued with much expectation of success: 4 for this and other\\nreasons it is very unlikely that the Charity School movement\\nmade any considerable contribution to the effective\\n____________________\\n1 T ravels, ed.

Throughout the eighteenth century utilitarian and\\nmercantilist objections to giving the poor a literate education\\nincreased. The current attitude was expressed by Bernard\\nMandeville with his usual forthrightness in his Essay on Charity\\nand Charity Schools ( 1723): \\'Reading, writing and arithmetic,\\nare . . . very pernicious to the Poor... Men who are to remain and\\nend their days in a laborious, tiresome and painful station of life,\\nthe sooner they are put upon it at first, the more patiently they\\'ll\\nsubmit to it for ever after.\\' 1\\nThis point of view was widely held, not only by employers and\\neconomic theorists, but by many of the poor themselves, both in\\nthe town and the country. Stephen Duck, the thresher poet, for\\nexample, was taken away from school at the age of fourteen by\\nhis mother \\'lest he become too fine a gentleman for the family\\nthat produced him\\'; 2 and many other children of the country\\npoor attended school only when they were not needed for work\\nin the fields. In the towns there was one factor at least which\\nwas even more hostile to popular education: the increasing\\nemployment of children from the age of five onwards to offset\\nthe shortage of industrial labour. Factory work was not as\\nsubject to seasonal factors, and the long hours left little or no\\ntime for schooling; and as a result it is likely that in some textile\\nand other manufacturing areas the level of popular literacy\\ntended to fall throughout the eighteenth century. 3\\nThere were, then, as is shown by the lives of the uneducated\\npoets and self-made men, such as Duck, James Lackington,\\nWilliam Hutton and John Clare, many serious obstacles in the\\n36\\nway of those members of the labouring classes who wanted to be\\nable to read and write; while the most pervasive factor of all in\\nrestricting literacy was probably the lack of positive inducement\\nto learn.

Perhaps\\nthe most significant of them from the writer\\'s point of view was\\nthe economic one.\\nTwo of the most reliable estimates of the average incomes of the\\nmain social groups, those of Gregory King in 16961 1 and of\\nDefoe in 1709, 2 show that more than half of the population was\\nshort of the bare necessities of life. King specifies that some\\n2,825,000 people out of a total population of 5,550,500,\\nconstituted an \\'unprofitable majority\\' who were \\'decreasing the\\nwealth of the kingdom\\'. This majority of the population was\\nmainly composed of cottagers, paupers, labouring people and\\noutservants; and King estimated that their average incomes\\nranged from £6 to £20 per annum per family. All these groups, it\\nis clear, lived so close to subsistence level that they can have\\nhad little to spare for such luxuries as books and newspapers.\\nBoth King and Defoe speak of an intermediate class, between the\\npoor and the well-to-do. King lists 1,990,000 people with family\\nincomes of between £38 and £60 per annum. They comprised:\\n1,410,000 \\'freeholders of the lesser sort, and farmers\\' with\\n37\\nannual incomes of £55 and £42: 10s.; 225,000 \\'shopkeepers and\\ntradesmen\\', at £45 per annum; and 240,000 \\'artisans and\\nhandicrafts\\', with average incomes of £38 a year. None of these\\nincomes would allow a large surplus for book-buying, especially\\nwhen one considers that the income given is for a whole family;\\nbut some money would be available among the richer farmers,\\nshopkeepers and tradesmen; and it is probable that changes\\nwithin this intermediate class account for the main increases in\\nthe eighteenth-century reading public.\\nThis increase was probably most marked in the towns, for the\\nnumber of small yeoman farmers is thought to have diminished\\n____________________\\n1 I n Natural and Political Observations and Conclusions upon the\\nState and Condition of England, 1696.\\n2 R eview, VI ( 1709), No. 36.\\n-40-\\nduring the period, and their incomes probably either stayed\\nstationary or decreased, 1 whereas there was a marked rise in\\nthe numbers and wealth of shopkeepers, independent tradesmen\\nand administrative and clerical employees throughout the\\neighteenth century. 2 Their increasing affluence probably brought\\nthem within the orbit of the middle-class culture, previously the\\nreserve of a smaller number of well-to-do merchants,\\nshopkeepers and important tradesmen. It is probably from them\\nthat the most substantial additions to the book-buying public\\nwere drawn, rather than from the impoverished majority of the\\npopulation.\\nThe high cost of books in the eighteenth century emphasises the\\nseverity of economic factors in restricting the reading public.\\nPrices were roughly comparable with those today, whereas\\naverage incomes were something like one-tenth of their present\\nmonetary value, with 10s. a week an average labourer\\'s wage,\\nand £1 a week a decent income for skilled journeymen or small\\nshopkeepers. 3 Charles Gildon sneered that \\'there\\'s not an old\\nwoman that can go to the price of it, but buys Robinson Crusoe\\':\\n4 there can surely have been few poor women who were buyers\\nof the original edition at five shillings a copy.\\nJust as there was a much greater contrast than today between\\nthe incomes of different classes, so there was a much greater\\nrange between the prices of different types of books. Magnificent\\nfolios for the libraries of the gentry and the rich merchants would\\n38\\ncost a guinea a volume or more, whereas a duodecimo, with\\nperhaps the same amount of reading, ranged from one to three\\nshillings. Pope\\'s Iliad, at six guineas the set, was far beyond the\\nreach of many members of the book-buying public; but very\\nsoon a pirated Dutch duodecimo and other cheaper versions\\nwere provided \\'for the gratification of those who were impatient\\nto read what they could not yet afford to buy\\'. 5\\nThese less affluent readers would not have been able to afford\\nthe French heroic romances, usually published in expensive\\nfolios.

They gradually came to be published in two or more small\\nduodecimo volumes, usually at 3s. bound, and 2s. 3d. in sheets.\\nThus Clarissa appeared in seven and later eight volumes, Tom\\nJones in six. The prices of novels, then, though moderate\\ncompared to larger works, were still far beyond the means of any\\nexcept the comfortably off: Tom Jones, for example, cost more\\nthan a labourer\\'s average weekly wage. It is certain, therefore,\\nthat the novel\\'s audience was not drawn from such a wide crosssection\\nof society as, for example, that of the Elizabethan drama.\\nAll but the destitute had been able to afford a penny occasionally\\nto stand in the pit of the Globe; it was no more than the price of\\na quart of ale. The price of a novel, on the other hand, would\\nfeed a family for a week or two. This is important. The novel in\\nthe eighteenth century was closer to the economic capacity of\\nthe middle-class additions to the reading public than were many\\nof the established and respectable forms of literature and\\nscholarship, but it was not, strictly speak-ing, a popular literary\\nform.\\nFor those on the lower economic fringes of the book-buying\\npublic there were, of course, many cheaper forms of printed\\nentertainment; ballads at a halfpenny or a penny; chapbooks\\n39\\ncontaining abbreviated chivalric romances, new stories of\\ncriminals, or accounts of extraordinary events, at prices ranging\\nfrom a penny to sixpence; pamphlets at threepence to a shilling;\\nand, above all, newspapers at the price of one penny until a tax\\nwas imposed in 1712, rising to three-halfpence or twopence until\\n1757, and eventually to threepence after 1776. Many of these\\nnewspapers contained short stories, or novels in serialised form -\\n- Robinson Crusoe, for example, was thus reprinted in the\\nOriginal London Post, a thrice-weekly journal, as well as in cheap\\nduodecimos and chapbooks. For our particular purposes,\\nhowever, this poorer public is not very important; the novelists\\nwith whom we are concerned did not have this form of\\npublication in mind, and the printers and publishers who\\nspecialised in it normally used works that had already been\\npublished in more expensive form, often without payment.\\nThe extent to which economic factors retarded the expansion of\\nthe reading public, and especially that for the novel, is suggested\\nby the rapid success of the non-proprietary or circulating\\nlibraries, as they were called after 1742 when the term\\n-42-\\nwas invented. 1 A few such libraries are recorded earlier,\\nespecially after 1725, but the rapid spread of the movement\\ncame after 1740, when the first circulating library was\\nestablished in London, to be followed by at least seven others\\nwithin a decade. Subscriptions were moderate: the usual charge\\nwas between half a guinea and a guinea a year, and there were\\noften facilities for borrowing books at the rate of a penny a\\nvolume or threepence for the usual three-volume novel.\\nMost circulating libraries stocked all types of literature, but\\nnovels were widely regarded as their main attraction: and there\\ncan be little doubt that they led to the most notable increase in\\nthe reading public for fiction which occurred during the century.\\nThey certainly provoked the greatest volume of contemporary\\ncomment about the spread of reading to the lower orders. These\\n\\'slop-shops in literature\\' 2 were said to have debauched the\\nminds of schoolboys, ploughboys, \\'servant women of the better\\nsort\\', 3 and even of \\'every butcher and baker, cobbler and tinker,\\nthroughout the three kingdoms\\'. 4 It is likely, therefore, that until\\n1740 a substantial marginal section of the reading public was\\nheldback from a full participation in the literaryscene by the high\\nprice of books; and further, that this marginal section was largely\\ncomposed of potential novel readers, many of them women.\\n41\\nThe distribution of leisure in the period supports and amplifies\\nthe picture already given of the composition of the reading\\npublic; and it also supplies the best evidence available to explain\\nthe increasing part in it played by women readers. For, while\\nmany of the nobility and gentry continued their cultural regress\\nfrom the Elizabethan courtier to Arnold\\'s \\'Barbarians\\', there was\\na parallel tendency for literature to become a primarily feminine\\npursuit.\\nAs so often, Addison is an early spokesman of a new trend. He\\nwrote in the Guardian ( 1713): \\'There are some reasons why\\nlearning is more adapted to the female world than to the male.\\nAs in the first place, because they have more spare time on their\\nhands, and lead a more sedentary life. . . .

It\\nwas not usual for them to engage in politics, business or the\\nadministration of their estates, while the main masculine leisure\\npursuits such as hunting and drinking were also barred. Such\\nwomen, therefore, had a great deal of leisure, and this leisure\\nwas often occupied by omnivorous reading.\\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu, for example, was an avid novel\\nreader, asking her daughter to send a list of novels copied down\\nfrom newspaper advertisements, and adding: \\'I doubt not that at\\nleast the greater part of these are trash, lumber, etc. However,\\nthey will serve to pass away the idle time. . . .\\' 3 Later, and at a\\n41\\ndefinitely lower social level, Mrs. Thrale recounted that by her\\nhusband\\'s orders she \\'was not to think of the kitchen\\' and\\nexplained that it was as a result of this enforced leisure that she\\nwas \\'driven... on literature as [her] sole resource\\'. 4\\nMany of the less well-to-do women also had much more leisure\\nthan previously. B. L. de Muralt had already found in 1694 that\\n\\'even among the common people the husbands seldom make\\ntheir wives work\\'; 5 and another foreign visitor to England, César\\nde Saussure, observed in 1727 that tradesmen\\'s wives were\\n\\'rather lazy, and few do any needlework\\'. 6 These reports reflect\\nthe great increase in feminine leisure which had been made\\npossible by an important economic change. The old household\\nduties of spinning and weaving, making bread, beer, candles and\\nsoap, and many others, were no longer necessary, since most\\nnecessities were now manufactured and could be bought at\\nshops and markets.

In rural areas further from London the economy\\nchanged much more slowly, and most women certainly continued\\nto devote themselves almost entirely to the multifarious duties of\\na household that was still largely selfsupporting. Nevertheless a\\ngreat increase in feminine leisure certainly occurred in the early\\neighteenth century, although it was probably mainly restricted to\\n42\\nLondon, its environs and the larger provincial towns.\\nHow much of this increased leisure was devoted to reading is\\ndifficult to determine. In the towns, and especially in London,\\ninnumerable competing entertainments offered themselves:\\nduring the season there were plays, operas, masquerades,\\nridottos, assemblies, drums, while the new watering-places and\\nresort towns catered for the summer months of the idle fair.\\nHowever, even the most ardent devotees of the pleasures of the\\ntown must have had some time left for reading; and the many\\nwomen who did not wish to partake of them, or could not afford\\nto, must have had much more. For those with puritan\\nbackgrounds, especially, reading would be a much more\\nunobjectionable resource. Isaac Watts, a very influential early\\neighteenthcentury Dissenter, dwelt luridly on \\'all the painful and\\ndismal consequences of lost and wasted time\\', 2 but he\\nencouraged his charges, very largely feminine, to pass their\\nleisure hours in reading and literary discussions. 3\\nThere is in the early eighteenth century a good deal of outraged\\ncomment about how the labouring classes were bringing ruin\\nupon themselves and the country by aspiring to the leisure\\npursuits of their betters. The implications of these jeremiads,\\nhowever, must be largely discounted. Not only because genteel\\n____________________\\n1 K alm\\'s Account of His Visit to England..., trans.

The traditional view was that class\\ndistinctions were the basis of social order, and that consequently\\nleisure pursuits were only proper for the leisure classes; and this\\noutlook was strongly reinforced by the economic theory of the\\nday which opposed anything which might keep the labouring\\nclasses away from their tasks. There was therefore considerable\\nagreement among the spokesmen both of mercantilism and of\\ntraditional religious and social thought that even reading\\n43\\nconstituted a dangerous distraction from the proper pursuits of\\nthose who worked with their hands. Robert Dean Bolton of\\nCarlisle, for instance, in his Essays on the Employment of Time (\\n1750), mentions the possibility of reading as a pastime for the\\npeasant and mechanic, only to reject it summarily: \\'No, the\\nadvice to him is, Observe what passes\\'. 1\\nThe opportunities of the poor for any extensive impropriety in\\nthis direction were in any case very small. Hours of work for\\nlabourers in the country included all the hours of daylight, and\\neven in London they were from six in the morning to eight or\\nnine at night. The usual holidays were only four -- Christmas,\\nEaster, Whitsun and Michaelmas, with the addition, in London, of\\nthe eight hanging days at Tyburn. It is true that labourers in\\nfavoured occupations, especially in London, could and did absent\\nthemselves from work fairly freely. But in the main conditions of\\nwork were not such as to give appreciable leisure except on\\nSundays; and then six days of labor ipse voluptas usually led to\\nthe seventh\\'s being devoted to activities more extrovert than\\nreading. Francis Place thought that drink was almost the only\\nworking-class recreation during the eighteenth century; 2 and it\\nmust be remembered that cheap gin made drunkenness\\navailable for less than the cost of a newspaper.\\nFor those few who might have liked to read there were other\\ndifficulties besides lack of leisure and the cost of books. There\\nwas little privacy, as, in London especially, housing was\\nappallingly overcrowded; and there was often not enough light to\\nread by, even by day. The window tax imposed at the end of the\\n____________________\\n1 P . 29.\\n2 G eorge, London Life, p. 289.\\n-46-\\nseventeenth century had reduced windows to a minimum, and\\nthose that remained were usually deepset, and covered with\\nhorn, paper or green glass. At night lighting was a serious\\nproblem, since candles, even farthing dips, were considered a\\nluxury. Richardson was proud of the fact that as an apprentice he\\nbought them for himself, 1 but others could not, or were not\\nallowed to. James Lackington, for example, was forbidden to\\nhave light in his room by his employer, a baker, and claims to\\nhave read by the light of the moon! 2\\nThere were, however, two large and important groups of\\n44\\nrelatively poor people who probably did have time and\\nopportunity to read -- apprentices and household servants,\\nespecially the latter. They would normally have leisure and light\\nto read by; there would often be books in the house; if there\\nwere not, since they did not have to pay for their food and\\nlodging, their wages and vails could be devoted to buying them if\\nthey chose; and they were, as ever, peculiarly liable to be\\ncontaminated by the example of their betters.\\nIt is certainly remarkable how many contemporary declamations\\nagainst the increased leisure, luxury and literary pretensions of\\nthe lower orders specifically refer to apprentices and domestic\\nservants, especially footmen and waiting-maids. In assessing the\\nliterary importance of this latter group it must be remembered\\nthat they constituted a very large and conspicuous class, which\\nin the eighteenth century probably constituted the largest single\\noccupational group in the country, as was the case, indeed, until\\nwithin living memory. Pamela, then, may be regarded as the\\nculture-heroine of a very powerful sisterhood of literate and\\nleisured waiting-maids. We note that her main stipulation for the\\nnew post she envisaged taking up after leaving Mr. B. was that it\\nshould allow her \\'a little Time for Reading\\'. 3 This emphasis\\nprefigured her triumph when, following a way of life rare in the\\nclass of the poor in general but less so in her particular vocation,\\nshe stormed the barriers of society and of literature alike by her\\nskilful employment of what may be called conspicuous literacy,\\nitself an eloquent tribute to the extent of her leisure.\\nEvidence on the availability and use of leisure thus confirms\\n____________________\\n1 A .

Despite a considerable\\nexpansion it still did not normally extend much further down the\\nsocial scale than to tradesmen and shopkeepers, with the\\nimportant exception of the more favoured apprentices and indoor\\nservants.

This is important, for it is probable that this\\n45\\nparticular change alone, even if it was of comparatively minor\\nproportions, may have altered the centre of gravity of the\\nreading public sufficiently to place the middle class as a whole in\\na dominating position for the first time.\\nIn looking for the effects of this change upon literature, no very\\ndirect or dramatic manifestations of middle-class tastes and\\ncapacities are to be expected, for the dominance of the middle\\nclass in the reading public had in any case been long preparing.\\nOne general effect of some interest for the rise of the novel,\\nhowever, seems to follow from the change in the centre of\\ngravity of the reading public. The fact that literature in the\\neighteenth century was addressed to an ever-widening audience\\nmust have weakened the relative importance of those readers\\nwith enough education and leisure to take a professional or semiprofessional\\ninterest in classical and modern letters; and in\\nreturn it must have increased the relative importance of those\\nwho desired an easier form of literary entertainment, even if it\\nhad little prestige among the literati.\\nPeople have always, presumably, read for pleasure and\\nrelaxation, among other things; but there seems to have arisen\\nin the eighteenth century a tendency to pursue these ends more\\nexclusively than before. Such, at least, was Steele view, put\\nforward in the Guardian ( 1713); he attacked the prevalence of:\\n. . . this unsettled way of reading... which naturally seduces us\\ninto as undetermined a manner of thinking.... That assemblage\\nof words which is called a style becomes utterly annihilated. . . .\\nThe common defence of these people is, that they have no\\ndesign in reading but for pleasure, which I think should rather\\narise from reflection and remembrance of what one had read,\\nthan from the transient satisfaction of what one does, and we\\nshould be pleased proportionately as we are profited. 1\\n____________________\\nNo. 60.\\n-48-\\n\\'The transient satisfaction of what one does\\' seems a peculiarly\\nappropriate description of the quality of the reading which was\\ncalled for by most examples of those two new eighteenth-century\\nliterary forms, the newspaper and the novel -- both obviously\\nencourage a rapid, inattentive, almost unconscious kind of\\nreading habit. The effortlessness of the satisfaction afforded by\\nfiction, indeed, had been urged in a passage from Huet Of the\\nOrigin of Romances which prefaced Samuel Croxall Select\\n46\\nCollection of Novels and Histories ( 1720):\\n. . . those discoveries which engage and possess [the mind] most\\neffectually are such as are obtained with the least labour,\\nwherein the imagination has the greatest share, and where the\\nsubject is such as is obvious to our senses... And of this sort are\\nromances; which are to be comprehended without any great\\nlabour of the mind, or the exercise of our rational faculty, and\\nwhere a strong fancy will be sufficient, with little or no burthen to\\nthe mernory. 1\\nThe new literary balance of power, then, probably tended to\\nfavour ease of entertainment at the expense of obedience to\\ntraditional critical standards, and it is certain that this change of\\nemphasis was an essential permissive factor for the\\nachievements of Defoe and Richardson. That these achievements\\nwere also related to other and more positive features of the\\ntastes and attitudes of the main accessions to the reading public\\nduring the period also seems likely: the outlook of the trading\\nclass, for instance, was much influenced by the economic\\nindividualism and the somewhat secularised puritanism which\\nfinds expression in the novels of Defoe; and the increasingly\\nimportant feminine component of the public found many of its\\ninterests expressed by Richardson. Consideration of these\\nrelationships, however, must be deferred until we have\\nconcluded the present survey of the reading public with an\\naccount of some of the other changes in its taste and\\norganisation.\\nII\\nBy far the greatest single category of books published in the\\neighteenth century, as in previous centuries, was that composed\\nof religious works. An average of over two hundred such works\\n____________________\\n1 1 729 ed., I, xiv.\\n-49-\\nwas published annually throughout the century. The Pilgrim\\'s\\nProgress -- although little noted by polite authors, and then\\nusually with derision -- went through one hundred and sixty\\neditions by 1792; 1 while at least ten devotional manuals had\\nsales of over thirty editions during the eighteenth century, and\\nmany other religious and didactic works were equally popular. 2\\n47\\nThese enormous sales, however, do not refute the view that\\neighteenth-century readers had increasingly secular tastes. To\\nbegin with, the number of religious publications does not seem to\\nhave increased in proportion either to the growth of the\\npopulation or to the sales of other types of reading matter. 3\\nFurther, the public for religious reading seems to have been\\nrather independent of that for secular literature. \\'Nobody reads\\nsermons but Methodists and Dissenters\\', says Smollett\\'s Henry\\nDavis , the London bookseller in Humphrey Clinker ( 1771), 4 and\\nhis view is partly supported by the paucity of references to\\npopular works of piety in the polite letters of the period.\\nOn the other hand, many readers, especially those from the less\\neducated strata of society, began with religious reading and\\npassed on to wider literary interests. Defoe and Richardson are\\nrepresentative figures in this trend. Their forebears, and those of\\nmany of their readers, would in the seventeenth century have\\nindulged in little but devotional reading; but they themselves\\ncombined religious and secular interests. Defoe, of course, wrote\\nboth novels and works of piety such as his Family Instructor;\\nwhile Richardson was conspicuously successful in carrying his\\nmoral and religious aims into the fashionable and predominantly\\nsecular field of fiction. This compromise, between the wits and\\nthe less educated, between the belles-lettres and religious\\ninstruction, is perhaps the most important trend in\\neighteenthcentury literature, and finds earlier expression in the\\nmost famous literary innovations of the century, the\\nestablishment of the Tatler in 1709 and of the Spectator in 1711.\\nThese periodicals, which appeared thrice-weekly and daily\\n____________________\\n1 F rank Mott Harrison, \"Editions of Pilgrim\\'s Progress\", Library,\\n4th ser., XXII ( 1941), 73.\\n2 I am indebted for these figures to Ivor W.

The Spectator and the Tatler were\\nmuch admired in Dissenting Academies 2 and among other\\ngroups where most other secular literature was frowned on: and\\nthey were often the first pieces of secular literature encountered\\nby uneducated provincial aspirants to letters.\\nThe periodical essay did much in forming a taste that the novel,\\ntoo, could cater for. Macaulay thought that if Addison had written\\na novel it would have been \\'superior to any that we possess\\'; 3\\nwhile T. H. Green, alluding to this, describes the Spectator as\\n\\'the first and best representative of that special style of literature\\n-- the only really popular literature of our time -which consists in\\ntalking to the public about itself. Humanity is taken as reflected\\nin the ordinary life of men... and... copied with the most minute\\nfidelity.\\' 4 Nevertheless, the transition from the de Coverley\\nPapers to the novel was by no means an immediate one, mainly\\nbecause succeeding journalists were uninspired and failed to\\ncreate a gallery of equally interesting characters; and this\\nparticular fictional direction was not continued in the second\\ngreat journalistic innovation in eighteenthcentury publishing --\\nthe foundation of the Gentleman\\'s Magazine by Edward Cave, a\\njournalist and bookseller, in 1731.\\nThis substantial monthly periodical combined the functions of\\npolitical journalism with the provision of more varied literary\\nfare, ranging from \\'An Impartial View of Various Weekly Essays\\'\\nto \\'Select Pieces of Poetry\\'. Cave tried to appeal to tastes even\\nmore various than those which the Spectator had catered for; in\\naddition to much solid information he provided highly\\nmiscellaneous fare that ranged from cooking recipes to\\nconundrums. He, too, was amazingly successful; Dr. Johnson\\nestimated the total circulation of the Magazine at ten thousand\\nand stated that it had twenty imitators; while Cave himself\\nasserted in 1741 that it was \\'read as far as the English language\\n____________________\\n1 T atler, No. 64 ( 1709).\\n2 D iary and Correspondence of Philip Doddridge ( London, 1829),\\nI, 152.\\n3 L iterary Essays ( London, 1923), p. 651.\\n4 \" Estimate of the Value and Influence of Works of Fiction in\\nModern Times\", Works, ed.

Further, the transition from the Spectator to the\\nGentleman\\'s Magazine demonstrates that a reading public had\\narisen which was largely independent of traditional literary\\nstandards, and which was therefore a potential public for a\\nliterary form unsanctified by established critical canons; the\\nnewspaper itself, as the Grub Street Journal remarked in a\\nsatirical obituary of Defoe, was \\'an amusement altogether\\nunknown in the age of Augustus\\'. 2 But, although journalism had\\nbrought many new recruits for secular literature into the reading\\npublic, that public\\'s taste for informative, improving, entertaining\\nand easy reading had not as yet found an appropriate fictional\\nform.\\nIII\\nThe Gentleman\\'s Magazine also symbolises an important change\\nin the organisation of the reading public. The Spectator had been\\nproduced by the best writers of the day; it catered to middleclass\\ntaste, but by a sort of literary philanthropy; Steele and Addison\\nwere for the middle-class way of life but they were not exactly of\\nit. Less than a generation later, however, the Gentleman\\'s\\nMagazine showed a very different social orientation: it was\\ndirected by an enterprising but ill-educated journalist and\\nbookseller, and its contributions were mainly provided by hacks\\nand amateurs. This change suggests a development of which\\nRichardson -- printer and brother-in-law of James Leake, a\\nbookseller and circulating library proprietor -- is himself an\\nimportant representative: the new prominence in the literary\\nscene of those engaged in the trades of manufacturing and\\nselling the products of the printing press. The main reason for\\nthis prominence is clear: the decline of literary patronage by the\\ncourt and the nobility had tended to create a vacuum between\\nthe author and his readers; and this vacuum had been quickly\\nfilled by the middlemen of the literary market-place, the\\npublishers, or, as they were then usually called, the booksellers,\\nwho\\n____________________\\n1 L ennart Carlson, The First Magazine (Providence, R.I., 1938),\\npp. 62-63, 77, 81.\\n2 N o. 90 ( 1731).\\n51\\n-52-\\noccupied a strategic position between author and printer, and\\nbetween both of these and the public.\\nBy the beginning of the eighteenth century, the booksellers,\\nespecially those in London, had achieved a financial standing, a\\nsocial prominence, and a literary importance considerably\\ngreater than that of either their forebears or of their counterparts\\nabroad. They had among their number several knights (Sir\\nJames Hodges, Sir Francis Gosling, Sir Charles Corbett), High\\nSheriffs ( Henry Lintot) and Members of Parliament ( William\\nStrahan); and many of them, such as the Tonsons, Bernard\\nLintot, Robert Dodsley and Andrew Millar, consorted with the\\ngreat figures of London life. Together with some of the printers\\nthey owned or controlled all the main channels of opinion,\\nnewspapers, magazines and critical reviews, and were thus well\\nplaced to secure advertising and favourable reviewing for their\\nwares. 1 This virtual monopoly of the channels of opinion also\\nbrought with it a monopoly of writers. For, despite the efforts to\\nallow independent access of authors to the public made by the\\nSociety for the Encouragement of Learning, \\'The Trade\\' remained\\nthe only fruitful form of publication for the author.\\nThe power of the booksellers to influence authors and audience\\nwas undoubtedly very great, and it is therefore necessary to\\ninquire whether this power was in any way connected with the\\nrise of the novel.\\nContemporary opinion was certainly much concerned with the\\nnew influence of the booksellers, and there were frequent\\nassertions that it had had the effect of turning literature itself\\ninto a mere market commodity. This view was expressed most\\nsuccinctly by Defoe, in 1725: \\'Writing... is become a very\\nconsiderable Branch of the English Commerce. The Booksellers\\nare the Master Manufacturers or Employers. The several Writers,\\nAuthors, Copyers, Sub-writers, and all other Operators with Pen\\nand Ink are the workmen employed by the said Master\\nManufacturers.\\' 2 Defoe did not condemn this commercialisation,\\nbut most of the spokesmen of traditional literary standards did\\nso in emphatic terms.

But in another sense Grub Street did exist, and for the first\\ntime: what Pope and his friends were really alarmed about was\\nthe subjection of literature to the economic laws of laissez-faire,\\na subjection which meant that the booksellers, whatever their\\nown tastes, were forced, in a phrase which George Cheyne used\\nin a letter to Richardson, to be \\'Curls by Profession\\'; 4 they had\\nto procure from the Grub Street Dunces whatever the public\\nmight wish to buy.\\nThe novel was widely regarded as a typical example of the\\ndebased kind of writing by which the booksellers pandered to the\\nreading public. Fielding\\'s friend and collaborator, for example,\\nJames Ralph, wrote in The Case of Authors ( 1758):\\nBook-making is the manufacture the bookseller must thrive by:\\nThe Rules of Trade oblige him to buy as cheap and sell as dear\\nas possible. . . . knowing best what Assortment of Wares will\\nbest suit the Market, he gives out his Orders accordingly; and is\\nas absolute in prescribing the Time of Publication, as in\\nproportioning the Pay.\\nThis will account in a good Degree for the Paroxysms of the\\npress: The sagacious Bookseller feels the Pulse of the Times, and\\naccording to the stroke, prescribes not to cure, but flatter the\\nDisease: As long as the Patient continues to swallow, he\\n52\\ncontinues\\n____________________\\n1 \" The Distresses of a Hired Writer\", 1761, in New Essays, ed.\\nCrane ( Chicago, 1927), p. 135.\\n2 T rue Patriot, No. 1, 1745.\\n3 \" Literature\", Social England, ed.

Hence the Cessation of all Political\\nCarminatives, and the Introduction of Cantharides, in the shape\\nof Tales, Novels, Romances, etc. 1\\nIn fact, however, it is very unlikely that the process was as\\nconscious and direct as Ralph suggests. He was writing at a time\\nwhen, after the great success of the novels of Richardson and\\nFielding, and the subsequent spread of circulating libraries, the\\nGrub Street hacks had been set to writing novels and translating\\nFrench ones on a considerable scale by such booksellers and\\ncirculating library proprietors as Francis and John Noble. Until\\nthen, however, there is very little evidence that the booksellers\\nplayed a direct part in stimulating the writing of novels; on the\\ncontrary, if we examine the works which the booksellers are\\nknown to have actively promoted, we find that their bias was\\nprimarily for large works of information such as Ephraim\\nChambers\\'s Cyclopaedia ( 1728), Johnson Dictionary ( 1755) and\\nhis Lives of the Poets ( 1779-1781), and many other historical\\nand scientific compilations, which they commissioned on a lavish\\nscale.\\nIt is true that it was two booksellers, Charles Rivington and John\\nOsborne, who asked Richardson to produce a popular guide to\\nfamiliar letter-writing, and thus supplied the initial impetus to the\\nwriting of Pamela. But Pamela itself was something of an\\naccident; Richardson, closely in touch with literary demand as he\\nwas, expressed his surprise at its \\'strange success\\' and sold twothirds\\nof the copyright for twenty pounds, although he was wiser\\nwith his two later novels. 2 Nor is it likely that Fielding\\'s crucial\\nexperiment, Joseph Andrews, was in any way the result of\\nencouragement from the booksellers. The tradition that Fielding\\nwas amazed when the bookseller Millar offered him two hundred\\npounds for the manuscript, and some shorter pieces, 3 certainly\\n53\\nsuggests that, although Millar, after the great success of Pamela,\\nanticipated large sales for Fielding\\'s first novel, neither he nor\\nanyone else had previously encouraged Fielding to take this new\\nliterary direction by suggesting that it was likely to be lucrative.\\nBut if the booksellers did little or nothing to promote the rise of\\nthe novel directly, there are some indications that, as an indirect\\nresult of their role in removing literature from the\\n____________________\\nP. 21.\\n2 S ee McKillop, Richardson, pp. 16, 27, 293-294.\\n3 C ross, Fielding, I, 313-316.\\n-55-\\ncontrol of patronage and bringing it under the control of the laws\\nof the market-place, they both assisted the development of one\\nof the characteristic technical innovations of the new form -- its\\ncopious particularity of description and explanation -- and made\\npossible the remarkable independence of Defoe and Richardson\\nfrom the classical critical tradition which was an indispensable\\ncondition of their literary achievement.\\nOnce the writer\\'s primary aim was no longer to satisfy the\\nstandards of patrons and the literary élite, other considerations\\ntook on a new importance. Two of them, at least, were likely to\\nencourage the author to prolixity: first, to write very explicitly\\nand even tautologically might help his less educated readers to\\nunderstand him easily; and secondly, since it was the bookseller,\\nnot the patron who rewarded him, speed and copiousness tended\\nto become the supreme economic virtues.\\nThis second tendency was pointed out by Goldsmith when he\\nconsidered the relationship between the bookseller and the\\nauthor in his Enquiry into the Present State of Learning ( 1759):\\n\\'There cannot perhaps be imagined a combination more\\nprejudicial to taste than this. It is the interest of the one to allow\\nas little for writing, and of the other to write as much, as\\npossible.\\' 1 Goldsmith\\'s view here finds some confirmation in the\\nfact that the specific accusation that an author wrote diffusely for\\neconomic reasons became fairly common in the early eighteenth\\ncentury; John Wesley, for example, suggested somewhat\\nuncharitably that Isaac Watts\\'s long-windedness was \\'to get\\nmoney\\'. 2 The possibility that this tendency may also have\\ninfluenced the rise of the novel finds some support in the fact\\nthat somewhat similar charges were also levelled at both Defoe\\n54\\nand Richardson.\\nThe most obvious result of the application of primarily economic\\ncriteria to the production of literature was to favour prose as\\nagainst verse. In Amelia ( 1751) Fielding\\'s hackney author\\nmakes this connection very clear: \\'A sheet is a sheet with the\\nbooksellers; and, whether it be in prose or verse, they make no\\ndifference\\'. 3 Consequently, finding that rhymes \\'are stubborn\\nthings\\', the denizen of Grub Street turns away from writing\\npoetry for the magazines and engages in the production of\\nnovels. For two reasons: because \\'romance writing is the only\\n____________________\\n1 W orks, ed. Cunningham ( New York, 1908), vi, 72-73.\\n2 A . P. Davis, Isaac Watts ( New York, 1943), p. 221.\\nBk. VIII, ch. 5.\\n-56-\\nbranch of our business that is worth following\\'; and because \\'it is\\ncertainly the easiest work in the world; you may write it almost\\nas fast as you can set pen to paper\\'.\\nDefoe\\'s own career had long before followed this course; after\\nusing the current medium of verse satire in his early career he\\nturned to an almost exclusive use of prose. This prose, of course,\\nwas easy, copious, unpremeditated -- the very qualities that\\nwere most consonant both with the narrative manner of his\\nnovels and with the maximum economic reward for his labours\\nwith the pen. Verbal grace, complication of structure,\\nconcentration of effect, all these take time and are likely to\\nrequire a good deal of revision, whereas Defoe seems to have\\ntaken the economic implications of the writer\\'s situation to an\\nunexampled extreme by considering revision as something to be\\nundertaken only if extra remuneration was offered. Such, at\\nleast, was the assertion of the anonymous editor of the 1738\\nedition of Defoe Complete English Tradesman, who wrote of\\nDefoe\\'s writings that they were \\'generally speaking... too\\nverbose and circumlocutory\\', and added that to have a complete\\nwork come off his hands, it was necessary to give him so much\\nper sheet to write it in his own way; and half as much afterwards\\nto lop off its excrescences, or abstract it....\\' 1\\nThere is somewhat similar evidence in the case of Richardson,\\nalthough the economic motive was probably much less pressing.\\nIn 1739 his friend Dr. George Cheyne reproved him for thinking\\nin terms of the booksellers\\' practice of valuing \\'the Price to the\\n55\\nAuthor by the Number of Sheets\\'. 2 Later, Shenstone wrote of\\nClarissa that Richardson had \\'needlessly spun out his Book to an\\nextravagant Prolixity... which he could scarce have done had he\\nnot been a Printer as well as an Author\\'; then -- with an\\nunconscious tribute to Richardson\\'s formal realism -- he\\ncontinued: \\'Nothing but Fact could authorise so much\\nparticularity, and indeed not that: but in a court of Justice\\'. 3\\nDefoe and Richardson, of course, did not break with classical\\nliterary criteria merely in the matter of prose style; they did so in\\nnearly every aspect of their vision of life, and of the techniques\\nby which it was embodied. Here, too, they are the expression of\\nthe profound changes in the social context of literature,\\n____________________\\n4th ed.\\n2 L etters to Richardson, ed. Mullett, p. 53.\\n3 L etters, ed. Mallam ( Minneapolis, 1939), p. 199.\\n-57-\\nchanges which further weakened the prestige of established\\ncritical standards.\\nThe mideighteenth century was well aware of how the new\\nbalance of power had revolutionised the recruitment both of\\ncritics and authors. According to Fielding the whole world of\\nletters was becoming \\'a democracy, or rather a downright\\nanarchy\\'; and there was no one to enforce the old laws, since, as\\nhe wrote in the Covent Garden Journal ( 1752), even the \\'offices\\nof criticism\\' had been taken over by \\'a large body of irregulars\\'\\nwho had been admitted \\'into the realm of criticism without\\nknowing one word of the ancient laws\\'. 1 A year later Dr. Johnson\\nsuggested in the Adventurer that the irregulars were equally\\npowerfully established in the field of authorship: \\'The present\\nage\\', he wrote, \\'may be styled, with great propriety, the Age of\\nAuthors; for, perhaps, there never was a time in which men of all\\ndegrees of ability, of every kind of education, of every profession\\nand employment, were posting with ardour so general to the\\npress\\'. Then, emphasising the contrast with the past, he added:\\n\\'The province of writing was formerly left to those who, by study\\nor appearance of study, were supposed to have gained\\nknowledge unattainable by the busy part of mankind\\'. 2\\nAmong the writers who could hardly have become so under the\\nold dispensation, and who knew little or nothing of the \\'ancient\\nlaws\\' of literature, we must certainly number those\\n56\\nrepresentative specimens of the busy part of eighteenth-century\\nmankind, Defoe and Richardson. Their ideas and training were\\nsuch that they could hardly have hoped to appeal to the old\\narbiters of literary destiny; but when we recall how adverse the\\nclassical viewpoint was to the requirements of formal realism, it\\nbecomes apparent that their very different allegiances were\\nprobably an essential condition for their literary innovations. Mrs.\\nChapone, indeed, drew this conclusion in Richardson\\'s case: \\'It is\\nonly from the ignorant that we can now have anything original;\\nevery master copies from those that are of established authority,\\nand does not look at the natural object\\'. 3 Defoe and Richardson\\nwere certainly freer to present \\'the natural object\\' in whatever\\nway they wished than were writers in France, for example, where\\nliterary culture was still primarily oriented to the Court; and it is\\nprobably for this reason that it was in England that the novel was\\nable to make an earlier and\\n____________________\\nNos. 23, 1.\\nNo. 115.\\n3 P osthumous Works. . ., 1807, I, 176.\\n-58-\\nmore complete break with the matter and manner of previous\\nfiction.\\nUltimately, however, the supersession of patronage by the\\nbooksellers, and the consequent independence of Defoe and\\nRichardson from the literary past, are merely reflections of a\\nlarger and even more important feature of the life of their time --\\nthe great power and self-confidence of the middle class as a\\nwhole. By virtue of their multifarious contacts with printing,\\nbookselling and journalism, Defoe and Richardson were in very\\ndirect contact with the new interests and capacities of the\\nreading public; but it is even more important that they\\nthemselves were wholly representative of the new centre of\\ngravity of that public. As middle-class London tradesmen they\\nhad only to consult their own standards of form and content to\\nbe sure that what they wrote would appeal to a large audience.\\nThis is probably the supremely important effect of the changed\\ncomposition of the reading public and the new dominance of the\\nbooksellers upon the rise of the novel; not so much that Defoe\\nand Richardson responded to the new needs of their audience,\\nbut that they were able to express those needs from the inside\\nmuch more freely than would previously have been possible.\\n57\\n-59-\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\'Robinson Crusoe\\', Individualism and the Novel\\nTHE novel\\'s serious concern with the daily lives of ordinary\\npeople seems to depend upon two important general conditions:\\nthe society must value every individual highly enough to consider\\nhim the proper subject of its serious literature; and there must\\nbe enough variety of belief and action among ordinary people for\\na detailed account of them to be of interest to other ordinary\\npeople, the readers of novels. It is probable that neither of these\\nconditions for the existence of the novel obtained very widely\\nuntil fairly recently, because they both depend on the rise of a\\nsociety characterised by that vast complex of interdependent\\nfactors denoted by the term \\'individualism\\'.\\nEven the word is recent, dating only from the middle of the\\nnineteenth century. In all ages, no doubt, and in all societies,\\nsome people have been \\'individualists\\' in the sense that they\\nwere egocentric, unique or conspicuously independent of current\\nopinions and habits; but the concept of individualism involves\\nmuch more than this. It posits a whole society mainly governed\\nby the idea of every individual\\'s intrinsic independence both from\\nother individuals and from that multifarious allegiance to past\\nmodes of thought and action denoted by the word \\'tradition\\' -- a\\nforce that is always social, not individual. The existence of such a\\nsociety, in turn, obviously depends on a special type of economic\\nand political organisation and on an appropriate ideology; more\\nspecifically, on an economic and political organisation which\\nallows its members a very wide range of choices in their actions,\\nand on an ideology primarily based, not on the tradition of the\\npast, but on the autonomy of the individual, irrespective of his\\nparticular social status or personal capacity. It is generally\\nagreed that modern society is uniquely individualist in these\\nrespects, and that of the many historical causes for its\\nemergence two are of supreme importance-the rise of modern\\nindustrial capitalism and the spread of Protestantism, especially\\nin its Calvinist or Puritan forms.\\n-60-\\nI\\nCapitalism brought a great increase of economic specialisation;\\nand this, combined with a less rigid and homogeneous social\\nstructure, and a less absolutist and more democratic political\\nsystem, enormously increased the individual\\'s freedom of choice.\\n58\\nFor those fully exposed to the new economic order, the effective\\nentity on which social arrangements were now based was no\\nlonger the family, nor the church, nor the guild, nor the\\ntownship, nor any other collective unit, but the individual: he\\nalone was primarily responsible for determining his own\\neconomic, social, political and religious roles.\\nIt is very difficult to say when this change of orientation began to\\naffect society as a whole-probably not until the nineteenth\\ncentury. But the movement certainly began much earlier. In the\\nsixteenth century the Reformation and the rise of national states\\ndecisively challenged the substantial social homogeneity of\\nmediaeval Christendom, and, in the famous words of Maitland,\\n\\'for the first time, the Absolute State faced the Absolute\\nIndividual\\'. Outside the political and religious sphere, however,\\nchange was slow, and it is likely that it was not until the further\\ndevelopment of industrial capitalism, especially in England and in\\nthe Low Countries, that a mainly individualist social and\\neconomic structure came into being and started to affect a\\nconsiderable part, although by no means a majority, of the total\\npopulation.\\nIt is, at least, generally agreed that the foundations of the new\\norder were laid in the period immediately following the Glorious\\nRevolution of 1689. The commercial and industrial classes, who\\nwere the prime agents in bringing about the individualist social\\norder, had achieved greater political and economic power; and\\nthis power was already being reflected in the domain of\\nliterature. The middle classes of the towns, we have seen, were\\nbecoming much more important in the reading public; and at the\\nsame time literature began to view trade, commerce and\\nindustry with favour. This was a rather new development. Earlier\\nwriters, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Ben Jonson and Dryden,\\nfor example, had tended to support the traditional economic and\\nsocial order and had attacked many of the symptoms of\\nemergent individualism. By the beginning of the eighteenth\\ncentury, however, Addison, Steele and Defoe\\n-61-\\nwere somewhat ostentatiously setting the seal of literary\\napproval on the heroes of economic individualism.\\nThe new orientation was equally evident in the philosophical\\ndomain. The great English empiricists of the seventeenth century\\nwere as vigorously individualist in their political and ethical\\nthought as in their epistemology. Bacon hoped to make a really\\n59\\nnew start in social theory by applying his inductive method to an\\naccumulation of factual data about a great number of particular\\nindividuals; 1 Hobbes, also feeling that he was dealing with a\\nsubject that had not been properly approached before, based his\\npolitical and ethical theory on the fundamentally egocentric\\npsychological constitution of the individual; 2 while in his Two\\nTreatises of Government ( 1690) Locke constructed the class\\nsystem of political thought based on the indefeasibility of\\nindividual rights, as against the more traditional ones of Church,\\nFamily or King. That these thinkers should have been the political\\nand psychological vanguard of nascent individualism, as well as\\nthe pioneers of its theory of knowledge, suggests how closely\\nlinked their reorientations were both in themselves and in\\nrelation to the innovations of the novel. For, just as there is a\\nbasic congruity between the non-realist nature of the literary\\nforms of the Greeks, their intensely social, or civic, moral\\noutlook, and their philosophical preference for the universal, so\\nthe modern novel is closely allied on the one hand to the realist\\nepistemology of the modern period, and on the other to the\\nindividualism of its social structure. In the literary, the\\nphilosophical and the social spheres alike the classical focus on\\nthe ideal, the universal and the corporate has shifted completely,\\nand the modern field of vision is mainly occupied by the discrete\\nparticular, the directly apprehended sensum, and the\\nautonomous individual.\\nDefoe, whose philosophical outlook has much in common with\\nthat of the English empiricists of the seventeenth century,\\nexpressed the diverse elements of individualism more completely\\nthan any previous writer, and his work offers a unique\\ndemonstration of the connection between individualism in its\\nmany forms and the rise of the novel. This connection is shown\\nparticularly clearly and comprehensively in his first novel,\\nRobinson Crusoe.\\n____________________\\n1 A dvancement of Learning, Bk.

Just\\nas \\'the body politic\\' was the symbol of the communal way of\\nthought typical of previous societies, so \\'economic man\\'\\nsymbolised the new outlook of individualism in its economic\\naspect. Adam Smith has been charged with the invention;\\nactually, the concept is much older, but it is natural that it should\\nhave come to the fore as an abstraction expressing the\\nindividualism of the economic system as a whole only when the\\nindividualism of that system itself had reached an advanced\\nstage of development.\\nThat Robinson Crusoe, like Defoe\\'s other main characters, Moll\\nFlanders, Roxana, Colonel Jacque and Captain Singleton, is an\\nembodiment of economic individualism hardly needs\\ndemonstration. All Defoe\\'s heroes pursue money, which he\\ncharacteristically called \\'the general denominating article in the\\nworld\\'; 1 and they pursue it very methodically according to the\\nprofit and loss book-keeping which Max Weber considered to be\\nthe distinctive technical feature of modern capitalism. 2 Defoe\\'s\\nheroes, we observe, have no need to learn this technique;\\nwhatever the circumstances of their birth and education, they\\nhave it in their blood, and keep us more fully informed of their\\npresent stocks of money and commodities than any other\\ncharacters in fiction. Crusoe\\'s book-keeping conscience, indeed,\\nhas established an effective priority over his other thoughts and\\nemotions; when his Lisbon steward offers him 160 moidores to\\nalleviate his momentary difficulties on return, Crusoe relates: \\'I\\ncould hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took\\n100 of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a\\nreceipt for them\\'. 3\\nBook-keeping is but one aspect of a central theme in the modern\\nsocial order. Our civilisation as a whole is based on individual\\ncontractual relationships, as opposed to the unwritten, traditional\\nand collective relationships of previous societies; and the idea of\\ncontract played an important part in the theoretical\\n____________________\\n1 R eview, III ( 1706), No. 3.\\n2 T he Theory of Social and Economic Organisation, trans.\\nHenderson and Parsons ( New York, 1947), pp. 186-202.\\n3 T he Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson\\nCrusoe, ed.

It had featured\\n61\\nprominently in the fight against the Stuarts, and it was enshrined\\nin Locke\\'s political system. Locke, indeed, thought that\\ncontractual relationships were binding even in the state of\\nnature; 1 Crusoe, we notice, acts like a good Lockean -- when\\nothers arrive on the island he forces them to accept his dominion\\nwith written contracts acknowledging his absolute power (even\\nthough we have previously been told that he has run out of ink).\\n2\\nBut the primacy of the economic motive, and an innate\\nreverence for book-keeping and the law of contract are by no\\nmeans the only matters in which Robinson Crusoe is a symbol of\\nthe processes associated with the rise of economic individualism.\\nThe hypostasis of the economic motive logically entails a\\ndevaluation of other modes of thought, feeling and action: the\\nvarious forms of traditional group relationship, the family, the\\nguild, the village, the sense of nationality -- all are weakened,\\nand so, too, are the competing claims of non-economic individual\\nachievement and enjoyment, ranging from spiritual salvation to\\nthe pleasures of recreation. 3\\nThis inclusive reordering of the components of human society\\ntends to occur wherever industrial capitalism becomes the\\ndominant force in the economic structure, 4 and it naturally\\nbecame evident particularly early in England. By the middle of\\nthe eighteenth century, indeed, it had already become something\\nof a commonplace. Goldsmith, for instance, thus described the\\nconcomitants of England\\'s vaunted freedom in The Traveller (\\n1764):\\nThat independence Britons prize too high, Keeps man from man,\\nand breaks the social tie; The self-dependent lordlings stand\\nalone, All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown; Here by\\nthe bonds of nature feebly held, Minds combat minds, repelling\\nand repell\\'d...

Not\\ntoo much importance can be attached to this fact, since\\nadventure stories demand the absence of conventional social\\nties. Still, in Robinson Crusoe at least, the hero has a home and\\nfamily, and leaves them for the classic reason of homo\\neconomicus -- that it is necessary to better his economic\\ncondition. \\'Something fatal in that propension of nature\\' calls him\\nto the sea and adventure, and against \\'settling to business\\' in the\\nstation to which he is born -- \\'the upper station of low life\\'; and\\nthis despite the panegyric which his father makes of that\\ncondition. Later he sees this lack of \\'confined desires\\', this\\ndissatisfaction with \\'the state wherein God and Nature has\\nplaced\\' him, as his \\'original sin\\'. 1 At the time, however, the\\nargument between his parents and himself is a debate, not about\\nfilial duty or religion, but about whether going or staying is likely\\nto be the most advantageous course materially: both sides\\naccept the economic argument as primary. And, of course,\\nCrusoe actually gains by his \\'original sin\\', and becomes richer\\nthan his father was.\\nCrusoe\\'s \\'original sin\\' is really the dynamic tendency of capitalism\\nitself, whose aim is never merely to maintain the status quo, but\\nto transform it incessantly. Leaving home, improving on the lot\\none was born to, is a vital feature of the individualist pattern of\\nlife. It may be regarded as the economic and social embodiment\\nof the \\'uneasiness\\' which Locke had made the centre of his\\nsystem of motivation, 2 an uneasiness whose existence was, in\\nthe very opposite outlook of Pascal, the index of the enduring\\nmisery of mortal man. \\'All the unhappiness of men arises from\\none single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own room\\'\\nPascal had written. 3 Defoe\\'s hero is far from agreeing. Even\\nwhen he is old, Crusoe tells us how: \\'. . . nothing else offering,\\nand finding that really stirring\\n____________________\\n1 L ife, pp. 2-6, 216.\\n63\\n2 H uman Understanding, Bk.

This is in direct contradiction to\\nthe great stress which Defoe lays on the social and religious\\nimportance of the family in his didactic works such as the Family\\nInstructor; but his novels reflect not theory but practice, and\\nthey accord these ties a very minor, and on the whole\\nobstructive, role.\\nRational scrutiny of one\\'s own economic interest may lead one to\\nbe as little bound by national as by family ties. Defoe certainly\\nvalued individuals and countries alike primarily on their economic\\nmerits. Thus one of his most patriotic utterances takes the\\ncharacteristic form of claiming that his compatriots have a\\ngreater productive output per hour than the workmen of any\\nother country. 2 Crusoe, we notice, whom Walter de la Mare has\\njustly called Defoe\\'s Elective Affinity, 3 shows xenophobia mainly\\nwhere the economic virtues are absent. When they are present --\\nas in the Spanish Governor, a French papist priest, a faithful\\nPortuguese factor -- his praise is unstinted. On the other hand,\\nhe condemns many Englishmen, such as his English settlers on\\nthe island, for their lack of industry. Crusoe, one feels, is not\\nbound to his country by sentimental ties, any more than to his\\nfamily; he is satisfied by people, whatever their nationality, who\\nare good to do business with; and he feels, like Moll Flanders,\\nthat \\'with money in the pocket one is at home anywhere\\'. 4\\nWhat might at first appear to place Robinson Crusoe in the\\nsomewhat special category of \\'Travel and Adventure\\' does not,\\nthen, altogether do so. The plot\\'s reliance on travel does tend to\\nallot Robinson Crusoe a somewhat peripheral position in the\\nnovel\\'s line of development, since it removes the hero from his\\nusual setting in a stable and cohesive pattern of social relations.\\n____________________\\n1 F arther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, ed.

More specifically, Robinson Crusoe\\'s career is based,\\nas modern scholarship has shown, 1 on some of the innumerable\\nvolumes which recounted the exploits of those voyagers who had\\ndone so much in the sixteenth century to assist the development\\nof capitalism by providing the gold, slaves and tropical products\\non which trade expansion depended; and who had continued the\\nprocess in the seventeenth century by developing the colonies\\nand world markets on which the future progress of capitalism\\ndepended.\\nDefoe\\'s plot, then, expresses some of the most important\\ntendencies of the life of his time, and it is this which sets his hero\\napart from most of the travellers in literature. Robinson Crusoe is\\nnot, like Autolycus, a commercial traveller rooted in an extended\\nbut still familiar locality; nor is he, like Ulysses, an unwilling\\nvoyager trying to get back to his family and his native land:\\nprofit is Crusoe\\'s only vocation, and the whole world is his\\nterritory.\\nThe primacy of individual economic advantage has tended to\\ndiminish the importance of personal as well as group\\nrelationships, and especially of those based on sex; for sex, as\\nWeber pointed out, 2 being one of the strongest non-rational\\nfactors in human life, is one of the strongest potential menaces\\nto the individual\\'s rational pursuit of economic ends, and it has\\ntherefore, as we shall see, been placed under particularly strong\\ncontrols in the ideology of industrial capitalism.\\nRomantic love has certainly had no greater antagonist among the\\nnovelists than Defoe. Even sexual satisfaction -- where he\\nspeaks of it -- tends to be minimised; he protested in The\\nReview, for example, that \\'the Trifle called Pleasure in it\\' was \\'not\\nworth the Repentance\\'. 3 As to marriage, his attitude is\\ncomplicated by the fact that economic and moral virtue in the\\n65\\nmale is no guarantee of a profitable matrimonial investment: on\\nhis colony \\'as\\n____________________\\n1 S ee especially A.

Only when his financial position has\\nbeen fully secured by a further voyage does he marry; and all he\\ntells us of this supreme human adventure is that it was \\'not\\neither to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction\\'. This, the birth of\\nthree children, and his wife\\'s death, however, comprise only the\\nearly part of a sentence, which ends with plans for a further\\nvoyage. 3\\nWomen have only one important role to play, and that is\\neconomic. When Crusoe\\'s colonists draw lots for five women, we\\nare gleefully informed that:\\nHe that drew to choose first... took her that was reckoned the\\nhomeliest and eldest of the five, which made mirth enough\\namong the rest... but the fellow considered better than any of\\nthem, that it was application and business that they were to\\n66\\nexpect assistance in as much as anything else; and she proved\\nthe best wife of all the parcel. 4\\n\\'The best wife of all the parcel.\\' The language of commerce here\\nreminds us that Dickens once decided on the basis of Defoe\\'s\\ntreatment of women that he must have been \\'a precious dry and\\ndisagreeable article himself\\'. 5\\n____________________\\n1 F arther Adventures, p. 78.\\n2 L ife, pp. 208-210, 225.\\n3 L ife, p. 341.\\n4 F arther Adventures, p. 77.\\n5 J ohn Forster, Life of Charles Dickens, revised Ley ( London,\\n1928), p. 611 n.\\n-68-\\nThe same devaluation of non-economic factors can be seen in\\nCrusoe\\'s other personal relationships. He treats them all in terms\\nof their commodity value. The clearest case is that of Xury, the\\nMoorish boy who helped him to escape from slavery and on\\nanother occasion offered to prove his devotion by sacrificing his\\nown life. Crusoe very properly resolves \\'to love him ever after\\'\\nand promises \\'to make him a great man\\'. But when chance leads\\nthem to the Portuguese Captain, who offers Crusoe sixty pieces\\nof eight -- twice Judas\\'s figure -- he cannot resist the bargain,\\nand sells Xury into slavery. He has momentary scruples, it is\\ntrue, but they are cheaply satisfied by securing a promise from\\nthe new owner to \\'set him free in ten years if he turn Christian\\'.\\nRemorse later supervenes, but only when the tasks of his island\\nlife make manpower more valuable to him than money. 1\\nCrusoe\\'s relations with Man Friday are similarly egocentric. He\\ndoes not ask him his name, but gives him one. Even in language\\n-- the medium whereby human beings may achieve something\\nmore than animal relationships with each other, as Crusoe\\nhimself wrote in his Serious Reflections 2 -- Crusoe is a strict\\nutilitarian. \\'I likewise taught him to say Yes and No\\', 3 he tells us;\\nbut Friday still speaks pidgin English at the end of their long\\nassociation, as Defoe\\'s contemporary critic Charles Gildon\\npointed out. 4\\nYet Crusoe regards the relationship as ideal. He is \\'as perfectly\\nand completely happy if any such thing as complete happiness\\ncan be found in a sublunary state\\'. 5 A functional silence, broken\\nonly by an occasional \\'No, Friday\\', or an abject \\'Yes, Master\\', is\\n67\\nthe golden music of Crusoe\\'s ile joyeuse. It seems that man\\'s\\nsocial nature, his need for friendship and understanding, is\\nwholly satisfied by the righteous bestowal or grateful receipt, of\\nbenevolent but not undemanding patronage. It is true that later,\\nas with Xury, Crusoe promises himself \\'to do something\\nconsiderable\\' for his servant, \\'if he outlive me\\'. Fortunately, no\\nsuch sacrifice is called for, as Friday dies at sea, to be rewarded\\nonly by a brief word of obituary compassion. 6\\n____________________\\n1 L ife, pp. 27, 34-36, 164.\\n2 S erious Reflections during the Life and Surprising Adventures\\nof Robinson Crusoe, ed.

For instance, after Crusoe has\\nleft, it is only when his faithful old agent in Lisbon reveals that he\\nis now a very rich man that we get any emotional climax: \\'I\\nturned pale and grew sick; and had not the old man run and\\nfetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had\\noverset nature, and I had died upon the spot\\'. 1 Only money --\\nfortune in its modern sense -- is a proper cause of deep feeling;\\nand friendship is accorded only to those who can safely be\\nentrusted with Crusoe\\'s economic interests.\\nSitting still, we saw, was \\'the unhappiest part of life\\' to Robinson\\nCrusoe; leisure pursuits are almost as bad.

The fewness of Defoe\\'s literary\\nfriendships has been commented on, and he is perhaps a unique\\nexample of a great writer who was very little interested in\\nliterature, and says nothing of interest about it as literature. 2\\nIn his blindness to aesthetic experience Crusoe is Defoe\\'s peer.\\nWe can say of him as Marx said of his archetypal capitalist:\\n\\'enjoyment is subordinated to capital, and the individual who\\nenjoys to the individual who capitalises\\'. 3 Some of the French\\nversions of Robinson Crusoe make him address hymns of praise\\nto nature, beginning \\'Oh Nature!\\' 4 Defoe did not.

Such, at least, was the general view of T. H.\\nGreen: \\'In the progressive division of labour, while we become\\nmore useful as citizens, we seem to lose our completeness as\\nmen... the perfect organisation of modern society removes the\\n69\\nexcitement of adventure and the occasion for independent effort.\\nThere is less of human interest to touch us within our calling.... \\'\\n\\'The alleviation\\' of this situation, Green concluded, \\'is to be found\\nin the newspaper and the novel.\\' 2\\nIt is very likely that the lack of variety and stimulation in the\\ndaily task as a result of economic specialisation is largely\\nresponsible for the unique dependence of the individual in our\\nculture upon the substitute experiences provided by the printing\\npress, particularly in the forms of journalism and the novel.\\nRobinson Crusoe, however, is a much more direct illustration of\\nGreen\\'s thesis, since much of its appeal obviously depends on\\nthe quality of the \\'occasions for independent effort\\' in the\\neconomic realm which it offers Defoe\\'s hero, efforts which the\\nreader can share vicariously. The appeal of these efforts is surely\\na measure of the depth of the deprivations involved by economic\\nspecialisation, deprivations whose far-reaching nature is\\n____________________\\n1 L ife, p. 75.\\n2 \" Estimate of the Value and Influence of Works of Fiction in\\nModern Times\", Works, ed.

When Crusoe makes bread, for instance, he reflects that\\n\"Tis a little wonderful and what I believe few people have\\nthought much upon, viz., the strange multitude of little things\\nnecessary in the providing, procuring, curing, dressing, making\\nand finishing this one article of bread\\'. 2 Defoe\\'s description goes\\non for seven pages, pages that would have been of little interest\\nto people in mediaeval or Tudor society, who saw this and other\\nbasic economic processes going on daily in their own households.\\nBut by the early eighteenth century, as Kalm reported, most\\nwomen did not \\'bake, because there is a baker in every parish or\\n71\\nvillage\\', 3 and Defoe could therefore expect his readers to be\\ninterested in the very detailed descriptions of the economic life\\nwhich comprise such an important and memorable part of his\\nnarrative.\\nRobinson Crusoe, of course, does not deal with the actual\\neconomic life of Defoe\\'s own time and place. It would be\\nsomewhat contrary to the facts of economic life under the\\ndivision of labour to show the average individual\\'s manual labour\\nas interesting or inspiring; to take Adam Smith\\'s famous\\nexample of the division of labour in The Wealth of Nations, 4 the\\nman who performs one of the many separate operations in the\\nmanufacture of a pin is unlikely to find his task as absorbing and\\ninteresting as Crusoe does. So Defoe sets back the economic\\nclock, and takes his hero to a primitive environment, where\\nlabour can be presented as varied and inspiring, and where it has\\nthe further significant difference from the pin-maker\\'s at home\\nthat there is an absolute equivalence between individual effort\\nand individual reward. This was the final change from\\ncontemporary\\n____________________\\n1 L ife, p. 74.\\n2 L ife, p. 130.\\n3 A ccount of His Visit to England, p. 326.\\nBk. I, ch. 1.\\n-72-\\neconomic conditions which was necessary to enable Defoe to\\ngive narrative expression to the ideological counterpart of the\\nDivision of Labour, the Dignity of Labour.\\nThe creed of the dignity of labour is not wholly modern: in\\nclassical times the Cynics and Stoics had opposed the denigration\\nof manual labour which is a necessary part of a slaveowning\\nsociety\\'s scale of values; and later, Christianity, originally\\nassociated mainly with slaves and the poor, had done much to\\nremove the odium on manual labour. The idea, however, was\\nonly fully developed in the modern period, presumably because\\nits compensatory affirmation became the more necessary as the\\ndevelopment of economic specialisation made manual labour\\nmore stultifying; and the creed itself is closely associated with\\nthe advent of Protestantism. Calvinism in particular tended to\\nmake its adherents forget the idea that labour was God\\'s\\npunishment for Adam\\'s disobedience, by emphasising the very\\ndifferent idea that untiring stewardship of the material gifts of\\n71\\nGod was a paramount religious and ethical obligation. 1\\nThe quality of Crusoe\\'s stewardship cannot be doubted; he\\nallows himself little time for rest, and even the advent of new\\nmanpower -- Friday\\'s -- is a signal, not for relaxation, but for\\nexpanded production. Defoe clearly belongs to the tradition of\\nAscetic Protestantism. He had written much that sounds like the\\nformulations of Weber, Troeltsch and Tawney; in Dickory\\nCronke\\'s aphorism, for example: \\'When you find yourself sleepy\\nin a morning, rouse yourself, and consider that you are born to\\nbusiness, and that in doing good in your generation, you answer\\nyour character and act like a man\\'. 2 He had even -with a certain\\nsophistic obtuseness -- propounded the view that the pursuit of\\neconomic utility was quite literally an imitation of Christ:\\n\\'Usefulness being the great pleasure, and justly deem\\'d by all\\ngood men the truest and noblest end of life, in which men come\\nnearest to the character of our B. Saviour, who went about doing\\ngood\\'. 3\\nDefoe\\'s attitude here exhibits a confusion of religious and\\nmaterial values to which the Puritan gospel of the dignity of\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Ernst Troeltsch, Social Teaching of the Christian Churches,\\ntrans.

It is likely that this\\nsecularisation of the Calvinist conception of stewardship was of\\nconsiderable importance for the rise of the novel. Robinson\\nCrusoe is certainly the first novel in the sense that it is the first\\nfictional narrative in which an ordinary person\\'s daily activities\\nare the centre of continuous literary attention. These activities, it\\nis true, are not seen in a wholly secular light; but later novelists\\ncould continue Defoe\\'s serious concern with man\\'s worldly doings\\nwithout placing them in a religious framework. It is therefore\\nlikely that the Puritan conception of the dignity of labour helped\\nto bring into being the novel\\'s general premise that the\\nindividual\\'s daily life is of sufficient importance and interest to be\\n72\\nthe proper subject of literature.\\nIII\\nEconomic individualism explains much of Crusoe\\'s character;\\neconomic specialisation and its associated ideology help to\\naccount for the appeal of his adventures; but it is Puritan\\nindividualism which controls his spiritual being.\\nTroeltsch has claimed that \\'the really permanent attainment of\\nindividualism was due to a religious, and not a secular\\nmovement, to the Reformation and not the Renaissance\\'. 1 It is\\nneither feasible nor profitable to attempt to establish priorities in\\nsuch matters, but it is certainly true that if there is one element\\nwhich all forms of Protestantism have in common it is the\\nreplacement of the rule of the Church as the mediator between\\nman and God by another view of religion in which it is the\\nindividual who is entrusted with the primary responsibility for his\\nown spiritual direction. Two aspects of this new Protestant\\nemphasis -- the tendency to increase consciousness of the self as\\na spiritual entity, and the tendency to a kind of democratisation\\nof the moral and social outlook -- are particularly important both\\nto Robinson Crusoe and to the development of the\\npresuppositions on which the formal realism of the novel is\\nbased.\\nThe idea of religious self-scrutiny as an important duty for each\\nindividual is, of course, much older than Protestantism;\\n____________________\\n1 S ocial Teaching, I, 328.\\n-74-\\nit derives from the individualist and subjective emphasis of\\nprimitive Christianity, and finds its supreme expression in St.\\nAugustine\\'s Confessions. But it is generally agreed that it was\\nCalvin, in the sixteenth century, who re-established and\\nsystematised this earlier pattern of purposive spiritual\\nintrospection, and made it the supreme religious ritual for the\\nlayman as well as for the priest: every good Puritan conducted a\\ncontinual scrutiny of his inner man for evidence of his own place\\nin the divine plot of election and reprobation.\\nThis \\'internalisation of conscience\\' is everywhere manifested in\\nCalvinism. In New England, it has been said, \\'almost every\\nliterate Puritan kept some sort of journal\\'; 1 and, in England,\\n73\\nGrace Abounding is the great monument of a way of life which\\nBunyan shared with the other members of his sect, 2 the\\nBaptists, who were, with one or two minor additions and\\nsubtractions, orthodox Calvinists. In later generations the\\nintrospective habit remained even where religious conviction\\nweakened, and there resulted the three greatest\\nautobiographical confessions of the modern period, those of\\nPepys, Rousseau and Boswell, all of whom were brought up\\nunder the Calvinist discipline; their fascination with self-analysis,\\nand indeed their extreme egocentricity, are character traits\\nwhich they shared both with later Calvinism in general 3 and with\\nDefoe\\'s heroes.\\n(a)\\nThe importance of this subjective and individualist spiritual\\npattern to Defoe\\'s work, and to the rise of the novel, is very\\nevident. Robinson Crusoe initiates that aspect of the novel\\'s\\ntreatment of experience which rivals the confessional\\nautobiography and outdoes other literary forms in bringing us\\nclose to the inward moral being of the individual; and it achieves\\nthis closeness to the inner life of the protagonist by using as\\nformal basis the autobiographical memoir which was the most\\nimmediate and widespread literary expression of the\\nintrospective tendency of Puritanism in general.\\nDefoe himself, of course, was born and bred a Puritan. His father\\nwas a Dissenter, perhaps a Baptist, more probably a\\nPresbyterian, in any case a Calvinist; and he sent his son to a\\n____________________\\n1 P erry Miller and Thomas H.

On the other hand, the note of his religious\\nreflections is often Puritan in character -- their tenor has been\\nseen by one theologian as very close to the Presbyterian Shorter\\nCatechism of the 1648 Westminster Assembly. 1 Crusoe certainly\\nexhibits frequent signs of Bibliolatry: he quotes some twenty\\nverses of the Bible in the first part of Robinson Crusoe alone,\\nbesides making many briefer references; and he sometimes\\nseeks divine guidance by opening the Bible at random. But the\\nmost significant aspect of his spiritual life is his tendency to\\nrigorous moral and religious self-examination. Each of his actions\\nis followed by a passage of reflection in which Crusoe ponders\\nover the problem of how it reveals the intentions of divine\\nprovidence. If the corn sprouts, it is surely a divine miracle \\'so\\ndirected for my sustenance\\'; if he has a bout of fever \\'a leisurely\\nreview of the miseries of death\\' 2 eventually convinces him that\\nhe deserves reprobation for neglecting to show his gratitude for\\nGod\\'s mercies to him. The modern reader no doubt tends to pay\\nlittle attention to these parts of the narrative; but Crusoe and his\\nauthor showed their point of view very clearly by allotting the\\nspiritual realm as much importance as the practical, both in\\nspace and emphasis. It would therefore appear that what are\\nprobably the vestigial remnants of the Calvinist introspective\\ndiscipline helped to provide us for the first time in the history of\\nfiction with a hero whose day-by-day mental and moral life is\\nfully shared by the reader.\\nThis crucial literary advance was not, of course, brought about\\nby the introspective tendency of Puritanism alone. As we have\\nseen, the gospel of work had a similar effect in giving the\\nindividual\\'s daily economic task almost as much importance as\\nhis daily spiritual self-examination; and the parallel effects of\\n____________________\\n1 J ames Moffat, \"The Religion of Robinson Crusoe\",\\nContemporary Review, CXV ( 1919), 669.\\n2 L ife, I, 85, 99.\\n-76-\\nboth these tendencies were supplemented by another closely\\nrelated tendency in Puritanism.\\nIf God had given the individual prime responsibility for his own\\nspiritual destiny, it followed that he must have made this\\n75\\npossible by signifying his intentions to the individual in the\\nevents of his daily life. The Puritan therefore tended to see every\\nitem in his personal experience as potentially rich in moral and\\nspiritual meaning; and Defoe\\'s hero is acting according to this\\ntradition when he tries to interpret so many of the mundane\\nevents of the narrative as divine pointers which may help him to\\nfind his own place in the eternal scheme of redemption and\\nreprobation.\\nIn that scheme, of course, all souls had equal chances, and it\\ntherefore followed that the individual had as full an opportunity\\nof showing his spiritual qualities in the ordinary conduct of life as\\nin its rarer and more dramatic exigencies. This was one reason\\nfor the general Puritan tendency towards the democratisation of\\nthe moral and social scale, and it was assisted by several other\\nfactors. There were, for instance, many social, moral and political\\nreasons why the Puritans should be hostile to the aristocratic\\nscale of values; nor could they fail to disapprove of its literary\\nexpression in the traditional heroes of romance, extrovert\\nconquerors whose victories are won, not in the spirit or in the\\ncounting-house but on the battlefield and in the boudoir. It is at\\nall events clear that Puritanism brought about a fundamental and\\nin a sense democratic orientation in the social and literary\\noutlook of its adherents, an orientation which was described by\\nMilton\\'s lines in Paradise Lost: \\'To know / That which before us\\nlies in daily life / Is the prime wisdom\\', 1 and which evoked one\\nof Defoe\\'s most eloquent pieces of writing, an essay in\\nApplebee\\'s Journal ( 1722) on the funeral of Marlborough. The\\nessay\\'s peroration begins:\\nWhat then is the work of life? What the business of great men,\\nthat pass the stage of the world in seeming triumph as these\\nmen, we call heroes, have done? Is it to grow great in the mouth\\nof fame, and take up many pages in history? Alas! that is no\\nmore than making a tale for the reading of posterity, till it turns\\ninto fable and romance. Is it to furnish subject to the poets, and\\nlive in their immortal rhymes, as they call them? That is, in\\nshort, no more than to be hereafter turned into ballad and song,\\nand be sung by\\n____________________\\nVIII, 192-194.\\n-77-\\nold women to quiet children; or, at the corner of a street, to\\ngather crowds in aid of the pickpocket and the whore. Or is their\\nbusiness rather to add virtue and piety to their glory, which\\n76\\nalone will pass them into Eternity, and make them truly\\nimmortal? What is glory without virtue? A great man without\\nreligion is no more than a great beast without a soul.\\nThen Defoe modulates into something more like the narrowly\\nethical evaluation of merit which was to be one of the legacies of\\nPuritanism to the middle-class code: \\'What is honour without\\nmerit? And what can be called true merit, but that which makes\\na person a good man, as well as a great man\\'. 1\\nNeither Crusoe, nor indeed any of Defoe\\'s heroes, it must be\\nadmitted, are conspicuous by these standards of virtue, religion,\\nmerit and goodness; and, of course, Defoe did not intend them\\nto be so. But these standards do represent the moral plane on\\nwhich Defoe\\'s novels exist, and by which his heroes must be\\njudged: the ethical scale has been so internalised and\\ndemocratised that, unlike the scale of achievement common in\\nepic or romance, it is relevant to the lives and actions of ordinary\\npeople. In this Defoe\\'s heroes are typical of the later characters\\nof the novel: Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders and even Colonel\\nJacque never think of glory or honour; they have their being on\\nthe moral plane of day-to-day living more completely than those\\nof previous narratives, and their thoughts and actions only\\nexhibit an ordinary, a democratic goodness and badness.\\nRobinson Crusoe, for instance, is Defoe\\'s most heroic character,\\nbut there is nothing unusual about his personality or the way he\\nfaces his strange experiences; as Coleridge pointed out, he is\\nessentially \\'the universal representative, the person, for whom\\nevery reader could substitute himself... nothing is done, thought,\\nsuffered, or desired, but what every man can imagine himself\\ndoing, thinking, feeling, or wishing for\\'. 2\\nDefoe\\'s presentation of Robinson Crusoe as the \\'universal\\nrepresentative\\' is intimately connected with the egalitarian\\ntendency of Puritanism in yet another way. For not only did this\\ntendency make the way the individual faced every problem of\\neveryday life a matter of deep and continuing spiritual concern;\\nit also encouraged a literary outlook which was suited to\\ndescribing such problems with the most detailed fidelity.\\n____________________\\n1 C it.

Potter, p. 419.\\n-78-\\nIn Mimesis, a brilliant panorama of realistic representation in\\n77\\nliterature from Homer to Virginia Woolf, Erich Auerbach has\\ndemonstrated the general connection between the Christian view\\nof man and the serious literary portrayal of ordinary people and\\nof common life. The classical theory of genres had reflected the\\nsocial and philosophical orientation of Greece and Rome: tragedy\\ndescribed the\\' heroic vicissitudes of people better than ourselves\\nin appropriately elevated language, whereas the domain of\\neveryday reality belonged to comedy which was supposed to\\nportray people \\'inferior to ourselves\\' in an appropriately \\'low\\'\\nstyle. Christian literature, however, reflecting a very different\\nsocial and philosophical outlook, had no place for this\\nStiltrennung or segregation of styles according to the class status\\nof the subject-matter. The gospel narratives treated the doings\\nof humble people with the utmost seriousness and on occasion,\\nindeed, with sublimity; later, this tradition was continued in\\nmany of the mediaeval literary forms, from the lives of the saints\\nto the miracle plays; and it eventually found its greatest\\nexpression in Dante\\'s Divina Commedia. 1\\nThe classicising tendencies of the Renaissance and the Counter-\\nReformation, however, re-established the old doctrine of genre,\\nand indeed elaborated it to an extent that would certainly have\\nsurprised Aristotle. The supreme example of this elaboration is\\nfound in French literature of the seventeenth century, and\\nespecially in tragedy; not only was the unremitting use of a fully\\ncodified style noble prescribed, but even the objects and actions\\nof everyday life were banished from the stage.\\nIn Protestant countries, however, the Stiltrennung never\\nachieved such authority, especially in England where\\nneoclassicism was confronted by the example of Shakespeare\\nand that characteristic mingling of the tragic and comic modes\\nwhich was part of his legacy from the Middle Ages. Nevertheless,\\nin one important respect even Shakespeare followed the\\nStiltrennung: his treatment of low and rustic characters is very\\nsimilar to that of the protagonists of the neo-classical tradition\\nfrom Ben Jonson to Dryden, and there is nothing egalitarian\\nabout it.

The two succeeding paragraphs\\ncontinue to summarise from Mimesis, except for what is said\\n78\\nabout Puritanism.\\n-79-\\nis very significant that the main exceptions to this derogatory\\nattitude are found in the works of Puritan writers. In Adam,\\nMilton created the first epic hero who is essentially a \\'universal\\nrepresentative\\'; Bunyan, seeing all souls as equal before God,\\naccorded the humble and their lives a much more serious and\\nsympathetic attention than they received in the other literature\\nof his period; while the works of Defoe are the supreme\\nillustration in the novel of the connection between the democratic\\nindividualism of Puritanism and the objective representation of\\nthe world of everyday reality and all those who inhabit it.\\n(b)\\nThere is a great difference, however, between Bunyan and\\nDefoe, a difference which suggests why it is Defoe, rather than\\nBunyan, who is often considered to be our first novelist. In the\\nearlier fiction of the Puritan movement -- in such works as Arthur\\nDent\\'s Plain Man\\'s Pathway to Heaven, or the stories of Bunyan\\nand his Baptist confrère Benjamin Keach -- we have many\\nelements of the novel: simple language, realistic descriptions of\\npersons and places, and a serious presentation of the moral\\nproblems of ordinary individuals. But the significance of the\\ncharacters and their actions largely depends upon a\\ntranscendental scheme of things: to say that the persons are\\nallegorical is to say that their earthly reality is not the main\\nobject of the writer, but rather that he hopes to make us see\\nthrough them a larger and unseen reality beyond time and place.\\nIn Defoe\\'s novels, on the other hand, although religious concerns\\nare present they have no such priority of status: indeed the\\nheritage of Puritanism is demonstrably too weak to supply a\\ncontinuous and controlling pattern for the hero\\'s experience. If,\\nfor example, we turn to the actual effect of Crusoe\\'s religion on\\nhis behaviour, we find that it has curiously little. Defoe often\\nsuggests that an incident is an act of Divine providence or\\nretribution, but this interpretation is rarely supported by the\\nfacts of the story. To take the crucial instance: if Crusoe\\'s\\noriginal sin was filial disobedience -- leaving home in the first\\nplace -- it is certain that no real retribution follows, since he does\\nvery well out of it; and later he often sets out for further\\njourneys without any fear that he may be flouting Providence.\\nThis indeed comes very near to the \\'neglect\\' of the \\'Cautions,\\nwarning and instruction... Providence\\' which Crusoe called a \\'kind\\n79\\nof\\n-80-\\nPractical Atheism\\' in his Serious Reflections. 1 Where Providence\\nis bringing blessings -- as, for instance, when he finds the grains\\nof corn and rice -- things are different: Crusoe need only accept.\\nBut the trilogy as a whole certainly suggests that any of the less\\nco-operative interventions of Providence can safely be neglected.\\nMarx sourly noted this somewhat gratuitous character of\\nCrusoe\\'s religious life. \\'Of his prayers we take no account, since\\nthey are a source of pleasure to him, and he looks on them as so\\nmuch recreation.\\' 2 He would have been pleased to find that\\nGildon thought that the \\'religious and useful reflections\\' were \\'in\\nreality... put in... to swell the bulk of Defoe\\'s treatise to a fiveshilling\\nbook\\'. 3 Both Marx and Gildon were right in drawing\\nattention to the discontinuity between the religious aspects of\\nthe book and its action: but their explanations do Defoe some\\ninjustice. His spiritual intentions were probably quite sincere, but\\nthey have the weakness of all \\'Sunday religion\\' and manifest\\nthemselves in somewhat unconvincing periodical tributes to the\\ntranscendent at times when a respite from real action and\\npractical intellectual effort is allowed or enforced. Such, certainly,\\nis Crusoe\\'s religion, and we feel that it is in the last analysis the\\nresult of an unresolved and probably unconscious conflict in\\nDefoe himself. He lived fully in the sphere of practical and\\nutilitarian action, and could be wholly true to his being when he\\ndescribed this aspect of Robinson Crusoe\\'s life. But his religious\\nupbringing forced him from time to time to hand over a brilliant\\npiece of narrative by a star-reporter to a distant colleague on the\\nreligious page who could be relied on to supply suitable spiritual\\ncommentaries quickly out of stock. Puritanism made the editorial\\npolicy unalterable; but it was usually satisfied by a purely formal\\nadherence. In this, too, Defoe is typical of the development of\\nPuritanism; in the phrase of H. W. Schneider, \\'beliefs seldom\\nbecome doubts; they become ritual \\'. 4 Otherworldly concerns do\\nnot provide the essential themes of Defoe\\'s novels: but they do\\npunctuate the narrative with comminatory codas that\\ndemonstrate a lifetime of somewhat mechanical practice.\\n____________________\\nP. 191.\\n2 C apital ( New York, 1906), p. 88.\\n3 R obinson Crusoe Examin\\'d, ed.

Defoe himself had been born at a time\\nwhen the Puritan Commonwealth had just collapsed at the\\nRestoration, while Robinson Crusoe was written in the year of the\\nSalters\\' Hall controversy, when, after the last hopes of Dissent in\\na compromise with the Anglican Church had been given up, even\\ntheir effort to unite among themselves proved impossible. In the\\nSerious Reflections of Robinson Crusoe Defoe\\'s hero meditates\\non the ebbing of the Christian religion throughout the world; it is\\na bitterly divided minority force in a largely pagan world, and\\nGod\\'s final intervention seems remoter than ever. Such, at least,\\nis the conclusion to which Robinson Crusoe is forced by his own\\nexperience in the last words of the book:\\n. . . no such zeal for the Christian religion will be found in our\\ndays, or perhaps in any age of the world, till Heaven beats the\\ndrums itself, and the glorious legions from above come down on\\npurpose to propagate the work, and reduce the whole world to\\nthe obedience of King Jesus -- a time which some tell us is not\\nfar off, but of which I heard nothing in all my travels and\\nilluminations, no, not one word. 1\\n\\'No, not one word\\': the dying fall leaves Crusoe to his despair.\\nWhat he was told to expect and what he has experienced do not\\nagree. Until heaven beats the drums itself he must reconcile\\nhimself to a pilgrim\\'s progress through an effectively secular\\nworld, make his own way along a path no longer clearly illumined\\nby God\\'s particular providences.\\nThe causes of secularisation in the period are many, but one of\\nthe most important, especially as far as Puritanism is concerned,\\nwas economic and social progress. In New England, for instance,\\nthe Pilgrim Fathers soon forgot that they had originally founded\\n\\'a plantation of religion, not a plantation of Trades\\'; and it has\\nbeen said that Governor Bradford, in his History of Plymouth\\nPlantation, shows how a Puritan saint came to write \\'less and\\nless like a Puritan preacher and more and more like the author of\\n81\\nRobinson Crusoe\\'. 2 In England, by Defoe\\'s\\n____________________\\np. 235.\\n2 W illiam Haller, The Rise of, Puritanism ( New York, 1938), p.\\n191.\\n-82-\\ntime, the more respectable dissenting sects at least were\\ndominated by wealthy and somewhat time-serving merchants\\nand financiers; and opportunities for further gain drove many\\nprosperous Dissenters not only to occasional conformity, but into\\nthe Anglican Church. 1 In his early years Defoe had violently\\ndenounced occasional conformity, but Robinson Crusoe, we\\nnotice, is an occasional conformist with a vengeance -- he even\\npasses as a Papist when it is economically expedient to do so.\\nThe conflict between spiritual and material values is an old one,\\nbut it was perhaps more obvious in the eighteenth century than\\nat any other time; more obvious because so many people\\nthought, apparently in perfectly good faith, that it did not really\\nexist. Bishop Warburton, for example, argued that \\'to provide for\\nutility is, at the same time, to provide for truth, its inseparable\\nassociate\\'. 2 The reluctance to consider the extent to which\\nspiritual and material values may be opposed is very marked in\\nDefoe\\'s novels, and it can even be argued that the crucial critical\\nproblem which they raise is whether they do not in fact confuse\\nthe whole issue. But, whatever our decision on this point, it is at\\nleast clear that the mere possibility of such a confusion only\\nexists because Defoe presents us with a narrative in which both\\n\\'high\\' and \\'low\\' motives are treated with equal seriousness: the\\nmoral continuum of his novels is much closer than was that of\\nany previous fiction to the complex combination of spiritual and\\nmaterial issues which moral choices in daily life customarily\\ninvolve.\\nIt would seem, then, that Defoe\\'s importance in the history of\\nthe novel is directly connected with the way his narrative\\nstructure embodied the struggle between Puritanism and the\\ntendency to secularisation which was rooted in material progress.\\nAt the same time it is also apparent that the secular and\\neconomic viewpoint is the dominant partner, and that it is this\\nwhich explains why it is Defoe, rather than Bunyan, who is\\nusually considered to be the first key figure in the rise of the\\nnovel.\\n82\\nDe Vogüé, the Catholic opponent of the French Realists, found an\\natheistic presumption in the novel\\'s exclusion of the\\n____________________\\n1 S ee A.

It is therefore\\nlikely that a measure of secularisation was an indispensable\\ncondition for the rise of the new genre. The novel could only\\nconcentrate on personal relations once most writers and readers\\nbelieved that individual human beings, and not collectivities such\\nas the Church, or transcendent actors, such as the Persons of the\\nTrinity, were allotted the supreme role on the earthly stage. The\\nnovel, Georg Lukács has written, is the epic of a world forsaken\\nby God; 2 it presents, in de Sade\\'s phrase, \\'le tableau des moeurs\\nséculaires\\'. 3\\nThis, of course, is not to say that the novelist himself or his novel\\ncannot be religious, but only that whatever the ends of the\\nnovelist may be, his means should be rigidly restricted to\\nterrestrial characters and actions: the realm of the spirit should\\nbe presented only through the subjective experiences of the\\ncharacters. Thus Dostoevsky\\'s novels, for example, in no sense\\ndepend for their verisimilitude or their significance on his\\nreligious views; divine intervention is not a necessary construct\\nfor an adequate and complete explanation of the causes and\\nmeanings of each action, as it is in Bunyan. Alyosha and Father\\nZossima are portrayed very objectively: indeed, the very\\nbrilliance of Dostoevsky\\'s presentation shows that he cannot\\nassume, but must prove, the reality of the spirit: and The\\nBrothers Karamazov as a whole does not depend upon any nonnaturalistic\\ncausation or significance to be effective and\\ncomplete.\\nTo sum up, we can say that the novel requires a world view\\nwhich is centred on the social relationships between individual\\npersons; and this involves secularisation as well as individualism,\\nbecause until the end of the seventeenth century the individual\\nwas not conceived as wholly autonomous, but as an element in a\\n83\\npicture which depended on divine persons for its meaning, as\\nwell as on traditional institutions such as Church and Kingship for\\nits secular pattern.\\nAt the same time the positive contribution of Puritanism, not only\\nto the development of modern individualism but to the rise\\n____________________\\n1 S ee F.

It was through Puritanism that Defoe brought\\ninto the novel a treatment of the individual\\'s psychological\\nconcerns that was a tremendous advance in the kind of forensic\\nratiocination which had previously passed for psychological\\ndescription in even the best of the romances, such as those of\\nMadame de La Fayette.

For we can say of him, as of later\\nnovelists in the same tradition, such as Samuel Richardson,\\nGeorge Eliot or D. H.

They all have an\\nintensely active conception of life as a continuous moral and\\nsocial struggle; they all see every event in ordinary life as\\nproposing an intrinsically moral issue on which reason and\\nconscience must be exerted to the full before right action is\\npossible; they all seek by introspection and observation to build\\ntheir own personal scheme of moral certainty; and in different\\nways they all manifest the self-righteous and somewhat angular\\nindividualism of the earlier Puritan character.\\nIV\\nWe have until now been primarily concerned with the light which\\nDefoe\\'s first work of fiction sheds on the nature of the\\nconnections between economic and religious individualism and\\nthe rise of the novel; but since the primary reason for our\\ninterest in Robinson Crusoe is its literary greatness, the relation\\nbetween that greatness and the way it reflects the deepest\\n84\\naspirations and dilemmas of individualism also requires brief\\nconsideration.\\nRobinson Crusoe falls most naturally into place, not with other\\nnovels, but with the great myths of Western civilisation, with\\nFaust, Don Juan and Don Quixote.

But it is also true that his character is\\nthroughout courting its fate and it merely happens that the island\\noffers the fullest opportunity for him to realise three associated\\ntendencies of modern civilisation -- absolute economic, social\\nand intellectual freedom for the individual.\\nIt was Crusoe\\'s realisation of intellectual freedom which made\\nRousseau propose the book as \\'the one book that teaches all that\\nbooks can teach\\' for the education of émile; he argued that \\'the\\nsurest way to raise oneself above prejudices, and order one\\'s\\njudgement on the real relationship between things, is to put\\noneself in the place of an isolated man, and to judge of\\neverything as that man would judge of them according to their\\n85\\nactual usefulness\\'. 1\\nOn his island Crusoe also enjoys the absolute freedom from\\nsocial restrictions for which Rousseau yearned -- there are no\\nfamily ties or civil authorities to interfere with his individual\\nautonomy. Even when he is no longer alone his personal\\nautarchy remains -- indeed it is increased: the parrot cries out\\nhis master\\'s name; unprompted Friday swears to be his slave for\\never; Crusoe toys with the fancy that he is an absolute monarch;\\nand one of his visitors even wonders if he is a god. 2\\nLastly, Crusoe\\'s island gives him the complete laissez-faire which\\neconomic man needs to realise his aims. At home market\\nconditions, taxation and problems of the labour supply make it\\n____________________\\n1 Ê mile, ou De l\\'éducation ( Paris, 1939), pp. 210, 214.\\n2 L ife, pp. 226, 164, 300, 284.\\n-86-\\nimpossible for the individual to control every aspect of\\nproduction, distribution and exchange. The conclusion is obvious.\\nFollow the call of the wide open places, discover an island that is\\ndesert only because it is barren of owners or competitors, and\\nthere build your personal Empire with the help of a Man Friday\\nwho needs no wages and makes it much easier to support the\\nwhite man\\'s burden.\\nSuch is the positive and prophetic side of Defoe\\'s story, the side\\nwhich makes Crusoe an inspiration to economists and educators,\\nand a symbol both for the displaced persons of urban capitalism,\\nsuch as Rousseau, and for its more practical heroes, the empire\\nbuilders. Crusoe realises all these ideal freedoms, and in doing so\\nhe is undoubtedly a distinctively modern culture-hero. Aristotle,\\nfor example, who thought that the man \\'who is unable to live in\\nsociety, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself,\\nmust be either a beast or a god\\', 1 would surely have found\\nCrusoe a very strange hero. Perhaps with reason; for it is surely\\ntrue that the ideal freedoms he achieves are both quite\\nimpracticable in the real world and in so far as they can be\\napplied, disastrous for human happiness.\\nIt may be objected that Robinson Crusoe\\'s achievements are\\ncredible and wholly convincing. This is so, but only because in his\\nnarrative -- perhaps as an unconscious victim of what Karl\\nMannheim has called the \\'Utopian mentality\\' which is dominated\\n86\\nby its will to action and consequently \\'turns its back on\\neverything which would shake its belief\\' 2 -- Defoe disregarded\\ntwo important facts: the social nature of all human economies,\\nand the actual psychological effects of solitude.\\nThe basis for Robinson Crusoe\\'s prosperity, of course, is the\\noriginal stock of tools which he loots from the shipwreck; they\\ncomprise, we are told, \\'the biggest magazine of all kinds... that\\nwas ever laid up for one man\\'. 3 So Defoe\\'s hero is not really a\\nprimitive nor a proletarian but a capitalist. In the island he owns\\nthe freehold of a rich though unimproved estate. Its possession,\\ncombined with the stock from the ship, are the miracles which\\nfortify the faith of the supporters of the new economic creed. But\\nonly that of the true believers: to the sceptic the classic idyll of\\nfree enterprise does not in fact sustain the view that anyone has\\never attained comfort and security only by his\\n____________________\\n1 P olitics, Bk. I, ch. 2.\\n2 I deology and Utopia ( London, 1936), p. 36.\\n3 L ife, p. 60.\\n-87-\\nown efforts. Crusoe is in fact the lucky heir to the labours of\\ncountless other individuals; his solitude is the measure, and the\\nprice of his luck, since it involves the fortunate decease of all the\\nother potential stockholders; and the shipwreck, far from being a\\ntragic peripety, is the deus ex machina which makes it possible\\nfor Defoe to present solitary labour, not as an alternative to a\\ndeath sentence, but as a solution to the perplexities of economic\\nand social reality.\\nThe psychological objection to Robinson Crusoe as a pattern of\\naction is also obvious. Just as society has made every individual\\nwhat he is, so the prolonged lack of society actually tends to\\nmake the individual relapse into a straightened primitivism of\\nthought and feeling. In Defoe\\'s sources for Robinson Crusoe\\nwhat actually happened to the castaways was at best\\nuninspiring. At worst, harassed by fear and dogged by ecological\\ndegradation, they sank more and more to the level of animals,\\nlost the use of speech, went mad, or died of inanition. One book\\nwhich Defoe had almost certainly read, The Voyages and Travels\\nof J. Albert de Mandelslo, tells of two such cases; of a Frenchman\\nwho, after only two years of solitude on Mauritius, tore his\\nclothing to pieces in a fit of madness brought on by a diet of raw\\ntortoise; and of a Dutch seaman on St. Helena who disinterred\\n87\\nthe body of a buried comrade and set out to sea in the coffin. 1\\nThese realities of absolute solitude were in keeping with the\\ntraditional view of its effects, as expressed by Dr. Johnson: the\\nsolitary mortal\\', he averred,\" was \\'certainly luxurious, probably\\nsuperstitious, and possibly mad: the mind stagnates for want of\\nemployment; grows morbid, and is extinguished like a candle in\\nfoul air\\'. 2\\nIn the story just the opposite happens: Crusoe turns his forsaken\\nestate into a triumph. Defoe departs from psychological\\nprobability in order to redeem his picture of man\\'s inexorable\\nsolitariness, and it is for this reason that he appeals very\\nstrongly to all who feel isolated -- and who at times does not? An\\ninner voice continually suggests to us that the human isolation\\nwhich individualism has fostered is painful and tends ultimately\\nto a life of apathetic animality and mental derangement; Defoe\\nanswers confidently that it can be made the arduous prelude to\\nthe fuller realisation of every individual\\'s potentialities; and\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Secord, Narrative Method of Defoe, pp. 28-29.\\n2 T hraliana, ed.

We have already seen how, although Defoe\\nhimself was an optimistic spokesman of the new economic and\\nsocial order, the unreflecting veracity of his vision as a novelist\\nled him to report many of the less inspiring phenomena\\nassociated with economic individualism which tended to isolate\\nman from his family and his country. Modern sociologists have\\nattributed very similar consequences to the other two major\\ntrends which are reflected in Robinson Crusoe. Max Weber, for\\nexample, has shown how the religious individualism of Calvin\\ncreated among its adherents a historically unprecedented \\'inner\\nisolation\\'; 1 while émile Durkheim derived from the division of\\nlabour and its associated changes many of the endless conflicts\\nand complexities of the norms of modern society, the anomie 2\\nwhich sets the individual on his own and, incidentally, provides\\n88\\nthe novelists with a rich mine of individual and social problems\\nwhen he portrays the life of his time.\\nDefoe himself seems to have been much more aware of the\\nlarger representativeness of his epic of solitude than is\\ncommonly assumed. Not wholly aware, since, as we have seen,\\nhe departed from its actual economic and psychological effects to\\nmake his hero\\'s struggles more cheering than they might\\notherwise have been; nevertheless Crusoe\\'s most eloquent\\nutterances are concerned with solitude as the universal state of\\nman.\\nThe Serious Reflections of Robinson Crusoe ( 1720) are actually\\na miscellaneous compilation of religious, moral and thaumaturgic\\nmaterial, and cannot, as a whole, be taken seriously as a part of\\nthe story: the volume was primarily put together to cash in on\\nthe great success of the first part of the trilogy, The Life and\\nStrange Surprising Adventures, and the smaller one of the\\nFurther Adventures. There are, however, in the prefaces, and the\\nfirst essay, \\'On Solitude\\', a number of valuable clues as to what,\\non second thoughts at least, Defoe saw as the meaning of his\\nhero\\'s experiences.\\n____________________\\n1 P rotestant Ethic, p. 108.\\n2 D e la division du travail social, Bk. II, chs. 1 and 3.\\n-89-\\nIn \\' Robinson Crusoe\\'s Preface\\' he suggests that the story\\n\\'though allegorical, is also historical\\': it is based on the life of \\'a\\nman alive, and well known too, the actions of whose life are the\\njust subject of these volumes, and to whom all or most part of\\nthe story most directly alludes\\'; and Defoe hints that he is\\nhimself the \\'original\\' of which Robinson Crusoe is the \\'emblem\\';\\nthat it is his own life which he is portraying allegorically.\\nMany critics have denied, and even derided the claim. Robinson\\nCrusoe had apparently been attacked as fictitious, and it is\\nargued that Defoe was merely using the allegorical argument\\nvery largely to controvert this criticism, and also to alleviate the\\npopular Puritan aversion to fiction which he largely shared. Still,\\nthe claim to some autobiographical relevance cannot be wholly\\nrejected: Robinson Crusoe is the only book for which he made\\nthe claim; and it fits in very well with much of what we know of\\nDefoe\\'s outlook and aspirations.\\n89\\nDefoe was himself an isolated and solitary figure in his time;\\nwitness the summary of his own life which he wrote in the\\npreface to a 1706 pamphlet, A Reply to a Pamphlet, Entitled \\'The\\nLord Haversham\\'s Vindication of His Speech where he complains:\\nhow I stand alone in the world, abandoned by those very people\\nthat own I have done them service;... how, with... no helps but\\nmy own industry, I have forced misfortune, and reduced them,\\nexclusive of composition, from seventeen to less than five\\nthousand pounds; how, in gaols, in retreats, in all manner of\\nextremities, I have supported myself without the assistance of\\nfriends or relations.\\n\\'Forcing his way with undiscouraged diligence\\' is surely the\\nheroism which Crusoe shares with his creator: and in \\' Robinson\\nCrusoe\\'s Preface\\' it is this quality which he mentions as the\\ninspiring theme of his book: \\'Here is invincible patience\\nrecommended under the worst of misery, indefatigable\\napplication and undaunted resolution under the greatest and\\nmost discouraging circumstances\\'.\\nHaving asserted an autobiographical meaning for his story, Defoe\\ngoes on to consider the problem of solitude. His discussion is an\\ninteresting illustration of Weber\\'s view of the effects of\\nCalvinism. Most of the argument is concerned with the Puritan\\ninsistence on the need for the individual to overcome the world\\nin his own soul, to achieve a spiritual solitude\\n-90-\\nwithout recourse to monasticism. \\'The business is to get a retired\\nsoul\\', he says, and goes on: \\'All the parts of a complete solitude\\nare to be as effectually enjoyed, if we please, and sufficient\\ngrace assisting, even in the most populous cities, among the\\nhurries of conversation and gallantry of a court, or the noise and\\nbusiness of a camp, as in the deserts of Arabia and Lybia, or in\\nthe desolate life of an uninhabited island\\'.\\nThis note, however, occasionally relapses into a more general\\nstatement of solitude as an enduring psychological fact: \\'All\\nreflection is carried home, and our dear self is, in one respect,\\nthe end of living. Hence man may be properly said to be alone in\\nthe midst of crowds and the hurry of men and business. All the\\nreflections which he makes are to himself; all that is pleasant he\\nembraces for himself; all that is irksome and grievous is tasted\\nbut by his own palate.\\' 1 Here the Puritan insistence on\\npossessing one\\'s soul intact from a sinful world is couched in\\n91\\nterms which suggest a more absolute, secular and personal\\nalienation from society. Later this echo of the redefined\\naloneness of Descartes\\'s solus ipse modulates into an anguished\\nsense of personal loneliness whose overpowering reality moves\\nDefoe to his most urgent and moving eloquence:\\nWhat are the sorrows of other men to us, and what their joy?\\nSomething we may be touched indeed with by the power of\\nsympathy, and a secret turn of the affections; but all the solid\\nreflection is directed to ourselves. Our meditations are all\\nsolitude in perfection; our passions are all exercised in\\nretirement; we love, we hate, we covet, we enjoy, all in privacy\\nand solitude. All that we communicate of those things to any\\nother is but for their assistance in the pursuit of our desires; the\\nend is at home; the enjoyment, the contemplation, is all solitude\\nand retirement; it is for ourselves we enjoy, and for ourselves we\\nsuffer.\\n\\'We covet, we enjoy, all in privacy and solitude\\': what really\\noccupies man is something that makes him solitary wherever he\\nis, and too aware of the interested nature of any relationship\\nwith other human beings to find any consolation there. \\'All that\\nwe communicate... to any other is but for their assistance in the\\npursuit of our desires1: a rationally conceived self-interest\\nmakes a mockery of speech; and the scene of Crusoe\\'s silent life\\nis not least a Utopia because its functional silence, broken only\\n____________________\\nPp. 7, 15, 2, 2-3.\\n-91-\\nby an occasional \\'Poor Robinson Crusoe\\' from the parrot, does\\nnot impose upon man\\'s ontological egocentricity the need to\\nassume a false façade of social intercourse, or to indulge in the\\nmockery of communication with his fellows.\\nRobinson Crusoe, then, presents a monitory image of the\\nultimate consequences of absolute individualism. But this\\ntendency, like all extreme tendencies, soon provoked a reaction.\\nAs soon as man\\'s aloneness was forced on the attention of\\nmankind, the close and complex nature of the individual\\'s\\ndependence on society, which had been taken for granted until it\\nwas challenged by individualism, began to receive much more\\ndetailed analysis. Man\\'s essentially social nature, for instance,\\nbecame one of the main topics of the eighteenth-century\\nphilosophers; and the greatest of them, David Hume, wrote in\\n91\\nthe Treatise of Human Nature ( 1739) a passage which might\\nalmost have been a refutation of Robinson Crusoe:\\nWe can form no wish which has not a reference to society. . . .\\nLet all the powers and elements of nature conspire to serve and\\nobey one man; let the sun rise and set at his command; the sea\\nand rivers roll as he pleases, and the earth still furnish\\nspontaneously whatever may be useful or agreeable to him; he\\nwill still be miserable, till you give him one person at least with\\nwhom he may share his happiness, and whose esteem and\\nfriendship he may enjoy. 1\\nJust as the modern study of society only began once\\nindividualism had focussed attention on man\\'s apparent\\ndisjunctions from his fellows, so the novel could only begin its\\nstudy of personal relationships once Robinson Crusoe had\\nrevealed a solitude that cried aloud for them. Defoe\\'s story is\\nperhaps not a novel in the usual sense since it deals so little with\\npersonal relations. But it is appropriate that the tradition of the\\nnovel should begin with a work that annihilated the relationships\\nof the traditional social order, and thus drew attention to the\\nopportunity and the need of building up a network of personal\\nrelationships on a new and conscious pattern; the terms of the\\nproblem of the novel and of modern thought alike were\\nestablished when the old order of moral and social relationships\\nwas shipwrecked, with Robinson Crusoe, by the rising tide of\\nindividualism.\\n____________________\\nBk. II, Pt. 2, Sect. V.\\n-92-\\nCHAPTER IV\\nDefoe as Novelist: \\'Moll Flanders\\'\\nT HERE has been much more disagreement among critics about\\nDefoe\\'s achievement than about that of the two later claimants\\nto the paternity of the novel, Richardson and Fielding. On the\\none hand, Leslie Stephen, commended by F. R. Leavis as having\\nsaid \\'all that need be said\\' about Defoe as a novelist, 1 remarks\\nthat \\'the merit of De Foe\\'s narratives bears a direct proportion to\\nthe intrinsic merit of a plain statement of the facts\\', 2 and thus\\nexpresses the common nineteenth-century view that, as William\\nMinto put it, Defoe was \\'a great, a truly great liar, perhaps the\\ngreatest that ever lived\\' 3 -- but little else. More recently Mark\\nSchorer, after an analysis of the connection in Moll Flanders\\n92\\nbetween moral inadequacy and primitive novelistic technique,\\nconcludes that the book is \\'our classic revelation of the\\nmercantile mind: the morality of measurement which Defoe has\\napparently neglected to measure\\'. 4 These critics -- and many\\nmore -- are unconvinced of Defoe\\'s claim to be considered a\\nmajor novelist. On the other hand, there are the many admirers\\nwho rate Defoe very high, from Coleridge (speaking, it is true,\\nonly of Robinson Crusoe) to Virginia Woolf, who writes that \\'Moll\\nFlanders and Roxana... stand among the few great English\\nnovels which we can call indisputably great\\'. 5\\nThe previous chapter on Robinson Crusoe suggested some of the\\nultimate historical reasons for the importance of Defoe in the\\ntradition of the novel; but it was not primarily concerned with the\\nissues on which the critical disagreement is based. Nor is\\nRobinson Crusoe the best example for such a purpose: although\\nit is probably Defoe\\'s most powerful and enduring work, and\\ncertainly his most popular one, Clara Reeve was surely right in\\nher early survey of fiction, The Progress of Romance ( 1785), 6 to\\n____________________\\n1 T he Great Tradition ( London, 1948), p. 2, n. 2.\\n2 \" \\'Defoe\\'s Novels\\'\", Hours in a Library ( London, 1899), I, 31.\\n3 D aniel Defoe ( London, 1887), p. 169.\\n4 \" \\'Introduction\\'\", Moll Flanders (Modern Library College Edition,\\nNew York, 1950), p. xiii.\\n5 \" \\'Defoe\\'\", The Common Reader, 1st Series ( London, 1938), p.\\n97.\\n6 I , 127.\\n-93-\\nclass it among \\'works singular and original\\'. Since E. M. Forster\\'s\\nAspects of the Novel ( 1927) at least, Moll Flanders has been\\nwidely taken as representative of what Defoe could achieve in\\nthe way of the novel proper, and -- although Colonel Jacque,\\nRoxana and A Journal of Plague Year all have some excellencies\\nunrivalled elsewhere -- it imposes itself as the best single work\\nfor the purpose of investigating Defoe\\'s methods as a novelist\\nand his place in the tradition of the novel.\\nThe pre-eminence of Moll Flanders among Defoe\\'s novels is in no\\nway the result of its being fundamentally different in subject and\\nattitude from Robinson Crusoe. The heroine, it is true, is a\\ncriminal; but the high incidence of crime in our civilisation is\\nitself mainly due to the wide diffusion of an individualist ideology\\nin a society where success is not easily or equally attainable to\\n93\\nall its members. 1 Moll Flanders, like Rastignac and Julien Sorel,\\nis a characteristic product of modern individualism in assuming\\nthat she owes it to herself to achieve the highest economic and\\nsocial rewards, and in using every available method to carry out\\nher resolve.\\nIt is because her crimes, like the travels of Robinson Crusoe, are\\nrooted in the dynamics of economic individualism that Moll\\nFlanders is essentially different from the protagonists of the\\npicaresque novel. The picaro happens to have a real historical\\nbasis -- the breakdown of the feudal social order -- but this is not\\nthe point of his adventures; he is not so much a complete\\nindividual personality whose actual life experiences are\\nsignificant in themselves as a literary convention for the\\npresentation of a variety of satiric observations and comic\\nepisodes. Defoe, on the other hand, presents his whores, pirates,\\nhighwaymen, shoplifters and adventurers as ordinary people who\\nare normal products of their environment, victims of\\ncircumstances which anyone might have experienced and which\\nprovoke exactly the same moral conflicts between means and\\nends as those faced by other members of society. Some of Moll\\nFlanders\\'s actions may be very similar to those of the picaro, but\\nthe feeling evoked by them is of a much more complete\\nsympathy and identification: author and reader alike cannot but\\ntake her and her problems much more seriously.\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Edwin H. Sutherland, Principles of Criminology, 4th ed. (\\nNew York, 1947), pp. 3-9, 69-81; Robert K. Merton, \"\\'Social\\nStructure and Anomie\\'\", American Sociological Review, III (\\n1938), 680.\\n-94-\\nThis seriousness extends to the dangers which she runs as a\\nresult of her criminal activities; her exposure to the sanctions of\\nthe law is much more continuous and rigorous than anything in\\npicaresque novels -- punishment is a reality, not a convention.\\nThis is in part a literary matter: the picaro enjoys that charmed\\nimmunity from the deeper stings of pain and death which is\\naccorded to all those fortunate enough to inhabit the world of\\ncomedy, whereas it is the essence of Defoe\\'s fictional world that\\nits pains, like its pleasures, are as solid as those of the real\\nworld. But the difference between Moll Flanders and the\\npicaresque novel is also the result of a specific social change\\nclosely related to the rise of individualism, a change whereby one\\nof the characteristic institutions of modern urban civilisation had\\n94\\ncome into existence by the early eighteenth century: a\\nwelldefined criminal class, and a complex system for handling it,\\nwith law-courts, informers and even crime reporters like Defoe.\\nIn the Middle Ages the examples of Christ and St. Francis gave\\nsanction to the view that poverty, far from being a disgrace,\\nmight well enhance the individual\\'s prospects of salvation. In the\\nsixteenth century, however, as a result of a new emphasis on\\neconomic achievement, the opposite viewpoint came to be widely\\naccepted: 1 indigence was both shameful in itself and\\npresumptive evidence of present wickedness and future\\ndamnation. This view is shared by Defoe\\'s heroes; they would\\nrather steal than beg, and they would lose their own self-respect\\n-- and the reader\\'s -- if they did not exhibit this characteristic\\nhubris of economic man.\\nThe acceptance of the aims of economic individualism also\\ninvolved a new attitude to society and its law. The very\\ndistinction between criminal and non-criminal only becomes\\nparamount when the individual\\'s orientation to life is determined,\\nnot by his acceptance of the positive standards of the\\ncommunity, but by his own personal aims which are restrained\\nonly by the legal power of authority. This process is very evident\\nin Moll Flanders: the law, in Goldsmith\\'s words, merely \\'forces\\nunwilling awe\\'; the polis has become the police.\\nThe more immediate social background of Moll Flanders is\\nprovided by the efforts of the state to deal with the growth of\\ncrime, especially in London. As theft increased, and the golden\\nage of the highwayman was signalised by The Beggar\\'s Opera\\n____________________\\n1 S ee A. V. Judges, The Elizabethan Underworld ( London,\\n1930), pp. xii-xxvi.\\n-95-\\n( 1728), punishments for offences against property became\\nmuch more severe: Moll Flanders is liable to hanging and is\\nactually transported for stealing \\'two pieces of brocaded silk\\',\\nwhile her mother suffered the same fate for \\'three pieces of fine\\nHolland\\'. 1 The actual form of their punishment brings us back to\\nthe world of Robinson Crusoe, and the connection between\\neconomic individualism and colonial development. Some ten\\nthousand metropolitan criminals were transported from the Old\\nBailey to the North American Plantations between 1717 and\\n1775; 2 many of them, like Moll Flanders and Colonel Jacque,\\n95\\nwere able to find legitimate expression there for the impulse\\nwhich had made them criminals at home.\\nAlthough Moll Flanders has a criminal background, then, it is\\nessentially an expression of forces and attitudes very closely\\nrelated to those analysed in Robinson Crusoe: similarly, although\\nthe literary form in which these forces and attitudes are\\nembodied in Moll Flanders is in some respects more successful or\\nat least more novelistic than elsewhere, it is not essentially\\ndifferent in kind; most of what is said here, therefore, on Defoe\\'s\\ntreatment of plot, character and total literary structure, holds\\ngood for all his novels, and for their general relationship to the\\nforces of individualism.\\nI\\nHere is an episode from the later life of Moll Flanders as a thief:\\nThe next thing of moment was an attempt at a gentlewoman\\'s\\ngold watch. It happened in a crowd, at a meeting house, where I\\nwas in very great danger of being taken. I had full hold of her\\nwatch, but giving a great jostle as if somebody had thrust me\\nagainst her, and in the juncture giving the watch a fair pull, I\\nfound it would not come, so I let it go that moment, and cried as\\nif I had been killed, that somebody had trod upon my foot, and\\nthat there was certainly pickpockets there, for somebody or\\nother had given a pull at my watch; for you are to observe that\\non these adventures we always went very well dressed, and I\\nhad very good clothes on, and a gold watch by my side, as like a\\nlady as other folks.\\nI had no sooner said so but the other gentlewoman cried out,\\n____________________\\n1 M oll Flanders, ed.

This, though unhappy for the wretch, was\\nvery opportunely for my case, though I had carried it handsomely\\nenough before; but now it was out of doubt, and all the loose part\\nof the crowd ran that way, and the poor boy was delivered up to the\\nrage of the street, which is a cruelty I need not describe, and which\\nhowever, they are always glad of, rather than be sent to Newgate,\\nwhere they lie often a long time and sometimes they are hanged,\\nand the best they can look for, if they are convicted is to be\\ntransported. 1\\nIt is very convincing. The gold watch is a real object, and it won\\'t\\ncome, even with \\'a fair pull\\'. The crowd is composed of solid bodies,\\npushing forwards and backwards, and lynching another pickpocket\\nin the street outside. All this happens in a real, particular place. It is\\ntrue that, as is his custom, Defoe makes no attempt to describe it in\\ndetail, but the little glimpses that emerge win us over completely to\\nits reality. A dissenting meeting-house is a piquant choice for these\\nactivities, to be sure, but Defoe does not arouse suspicion that he is\\na literary man by drawing attention to its ironic inappropriateness.\\nIf we have any doubts, they are concerned, not with the\\nauthenticity of the episode, but with its literary status. The\\nvividness of the scene itself is curiously incidental. Defoe gets into\\nthe middle of the action, with \\'I had full hold of her watch\\', and then\\nsuddenly changes from laconic reminiscent summary to a more\\ndetailed and immediate presentation, as though only to back up the\\ntruth of his initial statement. Nor has the scene been planned as a\\ncoherent whole: we are soon interrupted in the middle of the scene\\nby an aside explaining something that might have been explained\\nbefore, the important fact that Moll Flanders was dressed like a\\ngentlewoman herself: this transition\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 19-20.\\n-97-\\nadds to our trust that no ghost-writer has been imposing order\\non Moll Flanders\\'s somewhat rambling reminiscences, but if we\\nhad seen Moll dressed \\'as like a lady as other folks\\' from the\\nbeginning, the action would have run more strongly, because\\nuninterruptedly, into the next incident of the scene -- the raising\\n97\\nof the alarm.\\nDefoe goes on to stress the practical moral, which is that the\\ngentlewoman should have \\'seized the next body that was behind\\nher\\', instead of crying out. In so doing, Defoe lives up to the\\ndidactic purpose professed in the \\'Author\\'s Preface\\', but at the\\nsame time he directs our attention to the important problem of\\nwhat the point of view of the narrator is supposed to be. We\\npresume that it is a repentant Moll, speaking towards the end of\\nher life: it is therefore surprising that in the next paragraph she\\nshould gaily describe her \\'governess\\'s\\' procuring activities as\\n\\'pranks\\'. Then a further confusion about the point of view\\nbecomes apparent: we notice that to Moll Flanders other\\npickpockets, and the criminal fraternity in general, are a \\'they\\',\\nnot a \\'we\\'. She speaks as though she were not implicated in the\\ncommon lot of criminals; or is it, perhaps, Defoe who has\\nunconsciously dropped into the \\'they\\' he himself would naturally\\nuse for them? And earlier, when we are told that \\'the other\\ngentlewoman\\' cried out, we wonder why the word \\'other\\'? Is Moll\\nFlanders being ironical about the fact that she too was dressed\\nlike a gentlewoman, or has Defoe forgotten that, actually, she is\\nnot?\\nNor are these doubts about the completeness of Defoe\\'s control\\nover his narrative dispelled by the relationship, or rather lack of\\nrelationship, between this passage and the rest of the book. The\\ntransition to the next episode is somewhat confusing. It is\\neffected, first by the address to the reader explaining how to\\ndeal with pickpockets, and then by a somewhat confusing\\nrésumé of the governess\\'s life which is introduced by the words:\\n\\'I had another adventure, which puts this matter out of doubt,\\nand which may be an instruction for posterity in the case of a\\npickpocket\\'. We and posterity, however, remain uninstructed,\\nsince the ensuing adventure turns out to be concerned with\\nshoplifting: it seems likely that Defoe did not have the end of his\\nparagraph in mind when he began it, and improvised an\\nexpository transition to mark time until some other incident\\nsuggested itself.\\nThe connection between the meeting-house scene and the\\n-98-\\nnarrative as a whole confirms the impression that Defoe paid\\nlittle attention to the internal consistency of his story. When she\\nis transported to Virginia Moll Flanders gives her son a gold\\nwatch as a memento of their reunion; she relates how she\\n98\\n\\'desired he would now and then kiss it for my sake\\', and then\\nadds sardonically that she did not tell him \\'that I stole it from a\\ngentlewoman\\'s side, at a meeting house in London\\'. 1 Since there\\nis no other episode in Moll Flanders dealing with watches,\\ngentlewomen and meeting-houses, we must surely infer that\\nDefoe had a faint recollection of what he had written a hundred\\npages earlier about the attempt on the gentlewoman\\'s gold\\nwatch, but forgot that it had failed.\\nThese discontinuities strongly suggest that Defoe did not plan his\\nnovel as a coherent whole, but worked piecemeal, very rapidly,\\nand without any subsequent revision. This is indeed very likely\\non other grounds. His main aim as a writer was certainly to\\nachieve a large and effective output -- over fifteen hundred\\npages of print in the year that saw Moll Flanders; and this output\\nwas not primarily intended for a careful and critical audience.\\nThat Defoe had very little of the author\\'s usual fastidious attitude\\nto his work, or even of the author\\'s sensitiveness to adverse\\ncriticism, is very evident from the terms of his prefatory apology\\nfor the poetic imperfections of the work of which he was perhaps\\nmost proud, The True-Born Englishman: \\'. . . without being\\ntaken for a conjuror, I may venture to foretell, that I shall be\\ncavilled at about my mean style, rough verse, and incorrect\\nlanguage, things I indeed might have taken more care in. But\\nthe book is printed; and though I see some faults, it is too late to\\nmend them. And this is all I think needful to say...\\' If Defoe was\\nas nonchalant as this about an early work, and a poem at that, it\\nis surely unlikely that he gave a second thought to the possible\\ninconsistencies in a work of popular fiction such as Moll Flanders;\\nespecially as, for such an ill-regarded and ephemeral kind of\\nwriting, his publisher would probably not have offered the extra\\npayment which Defoe would apparently have required for\\nrevising his manuscript.\\nDefoe\\'s very casual attitude to his writing goes far to explain the\\ninconsistencies in matters of detail which are very common in all\\nhis works; the same lack of coherent initial plan or of later\\nrevision can be surmised in the nature of his narrative method.\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 158.\\n-99-\\nNearly all novels employ a combination of two different methods\\nof reporting: relatively full scenic presentation where, at a\\ndefinite time and place, the doings of the characters are reported\\n99\\nmore or less fully; and passages of barer and less detailed\\nsummary which set the stage and provide a necessary\\nconnective framework. The tendency of most novelists is to\\nreduce these latter synopses to a minimum and to focus as much\\nattention as possible on a few fully realised scenes; but this is\\nnot the case with Defoe. His story is told in over a hundred\\nrealised scenes whose average length is less than two pages,\\nand an equally large number of passages containing rapid and\\noften perfunctory connective synopses.\\nThe effect is obvious: almost every page offers evidence of the\\nfall in tension as we switch from episode to summary -- for a\\nminute Moll Flanders will appear brilliantly illumined, only to fall\\nback into the semi-darkness of confused recollection. It is certain\\nthat it is the fully presented episodes which include all that is\\nvivid and memorable in Moll Flanders, and which are rightly\\nquoted by enthusiasts as evidence of Defoe\\'s narrative genius;\\nbut they surely forget how large a proportion of the book is\\noccupied by uninspired summary, plaster over an inordinate\\nnumber of cracks. Defoe, certainly, makes no effort to reduce the\\namount of patchwork required by consolidating the episodes into\\nas large units as possible. The first main group of episodes, for\\nexample, when Moll is seduced by the Elder Brother, is divided\\ninto a very large number of separate encounters between the\\ncharacters concerned, each of whose effectiveness is largely\\ndissipated as the narrative relapses into bare summary. Similarly\\nMoll\\'s reaction to the discovery of the incestuous nature of her\\nmarriage to her half-brother is split up into so many separate\\nscenes that the emotional force of the episode as a whole is\\nmuch weakened.\\nThis somewhat primitive aspect of Defoe\\'s narrative technique is\\npartly a reflection of the nature of his basic literary purpose -- to\\nproduce a convincing likeness to the autobiographical memoir of\\na real person; and it will therefore require further examination in\\nthis larger context. First, however, the present analysis of the\\nmeeting-house passage must be concluded by a brief\\nconsideration of what is surely its most strikingly successful\\naspect -- its prose.\\nDefoe\\'s prose is not in the ordinary sense well-written, but it\\n-100-\\nis remarkably effective in keeping us very close to the\\nconsciousness of Moll Flanders as she struggles to make her\\nrecollection clear: as we read we feel that nothing but an\\n111\\nexclusive concentration on this single aim could account for such\\ncomplete disregard of normal stylistic considerations -- the\\nrepetitions and parentheses, the unpremeditated and sometimes\\nstumbling rhythm, the long and involved sequences of coordinate\\nclauses. The length of the sentences might at first sight\\nseem to interfere with the effect of spontaneous authenticity; but\\nin fact the lack of marked pauses within the sentences, and the\\nfrequent recapitulations, tend to heighten the effect.\\nThe most remarkable thing about the prose of the passage is\\nperhaps the fact that it is Defoe\\'s usual style. No previous\\nauthor\\'s normal way of writing could so credibly have passed for\\nthe characteristic utterance of such an uneducated person as\\nMoll Flanders; that Defoe\\'s prose could do so quite naturally is\\npartly the result of the changes in the situation of authors\\ndescribed in the second chapter, and partly of many other\\nconverging forces which, in the last few decades of the\\nseventeenth century, had already done much to bring the\\nlanguage of literature much closer to the speech habits and the\\ncomprehension of the ordinary reader.\\nThe first of these forces was the attempt of the Royal Society to\\ndevelop a more factual prose. This cannot be considered of\\nprimary importance in the formation of Defoe\\'s style, although\\nthere may have been some influence through the scientific and\\nmodern bias of the curriculum of the dissenting academy at\\nNewington Green which he attended. Certainly Defoe\\'s prose\\nfully exemplifies the celebrated programme of Bishop Sprat: \\'a\\nclose, naked, natural way of speaking; positive expressions;\\nclear senses; a native easiness; bringing all things as near the\\nmathematical plainness as they can: and preferring the language\\nof artisans, countrymen and merchants before that of wits or\\nscholars\\'. 1 Defoe naturally preferred such language since he was\\na merchant himself. His vocabulary is certainly that of \\'artisans\\nand countrymen\\' in the sense that it contains a higher proportion\\nof words of Anglo-Saxon origin than that of any other well-known\\nwriter, with the significant exception of Bunyan; 2\\n____________________\\n1 H istory of the Royal Society, 1667, p. 113.\\n2 G ustaf Lannert, Investigation of the Language of \\'Robinson\\nCrusoe\\' ( Uppsala, 1910), p. 13.\\n-101-\\nat the same time it has a certain \\'mathematical plainness\\', a\\npositive and wholly referential quality very well suited to carrying\\n111\\nout the purpose of language as Locke had defined it, \\'to convey\\nthe knowledge of things\\'. Indeed Defoe\\'s style reflects the\\nLockean philosophy in one very significant detail: he is usually\\ncontent with denoting only the primary qualities of the objects he\\ndescribes -- their solidity, extension, figure, motion and number\\n-- especially number: there is very little attention to the\\nsecondary qualities of objects, to their colours, sounds or tastes.\\n1\\nThe simple and positive quality of Defoe\\'s prose, then, embodies\\nthe new values of the scientific and rational outlook of the late\\nseventeenth century; but this was also the tendency of certain\\nnew styles of preaching. Richard Baxter, for example, whom\\nDefoe had read and whose religious position was very similar to\\nhis own, made plainness his supreme aim; and it was plainness\\nof a quasi-scientific kind, since his purpose was to bring home to\\nhis audience what he described as \\'Soul Experiments\\', \\'Heart\\nOccurrences\\' and \\'God\\'s Operations\\'. 2 Even Baxter\\'s mode of\\nemphasis, his technique of persuasion, depended almost entirely\\non the simplest of rhetorical devices, repetition. In this, and in\\nhis whole theory and practice, indeed, he was very close to\\nDefoe: how close is suggested by Baxter\\'s account of the\\nconsiderations that had swayed him when forming his style as a\\npreacher:\\nThe more I have to do with ignorant sort of people the more I\\nfind that we cannot possibly speak too plainly to them. If we do\\nnot use their own vulgar dialect, they understand us not. Nay, if\\nwe do so, yet if we compose those very words into a\\nhandsomeness of sentence, or if we speak anything briefly, they\\nfeel not what we say. Nay, I find if we do not purposely dress out\\nthe matter into such a length of words, and use some repetition\\nof it, that they may hear it inculcated on them again, we do but\\noverrun their understandings, and they presently lose us. That\\nvery style and way that is apt to be a little offensive to the exact\\nand that is tedious and loathsome to the curious ear... must be it\\nthat must do most good upon the ignorant. 3\\n____________________\\n1 H uman Understanding, Bk.

Powicke, Life of the Reverend Richard Baxter, 1615-\\n1691 ( London, 1924), pp. 283-284. Among the evidence for\\nDefoe\\'s interest in Baxter may be mentioned the fact that he\\nquotes at least two of his works ( Gükel and Günther,\\nBelesenheit, p. 8).\\n112\\n-102-\\nDefoe\\'s prose is probably a good deal closer to \\'vulgar dialect\\'\\nand understanding than anything envisaged by Sprat or Baxter;\\nmainly for the reason suggested by Defoe\\'s own statement that\\n\\'Preaching of sermons is speaking to a few of mankind: printing\\nof books is talking to the whole world\\'. 1 Defoe, as a journalist,\\nwrote for the largest audience of all, and his concessions to its\\ncapacities were therefore much greater. He told his readers in\\nthe Review that he had \\'chosen a down-right plainness, and to\\nspeak home both in fact and style\\' because it was \\'more\\ngenerally instructing and clear to the understanding of the people\\nI am speaking to\\'; 2 he was fully aware that as a result the more\\neducated readers might consider him clumsy and repetitive, but\\nurged that he \\'must be borne with in that tautology, for the sake\\nof evident and public utility\\'. 3\\nThe direct connection between Defoe\\'s early years as a journalist\\nand pamphleteer and the verisimilitude of his novels is suggested\\nby the case of his first famous piece of narrative, The True\\nRelation of the Apparition of Mrs. Veal ( I706). Leslie Stephen\\nused it to illustrate Defoe\\'s fictional methods as a novelist; 4\\nactually Defoe was reporting what he heard when he went down\\nto Canterbury to interview a Mrs. Bargrave who had seen the\\napparition in question. It cannot be denied, however, that what\\nStephen says about \\'the manufacturing of corroborative\\nevidence\\' and the \\'deflection of interest\\' from the weak links in\\nthe chain of argument applies perfectly to the novels, if not to\\nMrs. Veal; and some part of Defoe\\'s notable success in the art of\\nenlisting our belief in his fictions may, therefore, be attributed,\\nwithout undue cynicism, to his training in the hard school of\\njournalism.\\nThe nature of Defoe\\'s journalistic experience had been\\nparticularly well adapted to further his later career as a novelist\\nbecause, in the course of writing his thrice-weekly newspaper,\\nThe Review, almost single-handed for a period of some nine\\nyears -- from 1704 to 1713, he had developed himself as an\\neditorial character, \\'Mr. Review\\', with a markedly personal\\nmanner of writing.

His works\\ninvite, more justly than most, the familiar encomium that \\'once\\ntaken up they cannot easily be laid down\\'. Indeed Defoe had the\\nindelicate prescience to advance the claim on his own behalf, for he\\nconcluded his preface to the Memoirs of a Cavalier, with more than\\nhis wonted syntactical inelegance, \\'. . . nothing more can invite than\\nthe story itself, which, when the reader enters into, he will find it\\nvery hard to get out of, until he has gone through it\\'.\\nII\\nDefoe\\'s novels are landmarks in the history of fiction largely\\nbecause they are the first considerable narratives which embody all\\nthe elements of formal realism. But although formal realism helps to\\ndefine the uniqueness of the novel, it obviously does not by any\\nmeans exhaust our critical desiderata about it; the novel may have\\na distinctive representational technique, but if it is to be considered\\na valuable literary form it must also have, like any other literary\\nform, a structure which is a coherent expression of all its parts. Our\\npreliminary examination has suggested several doubts about the\\ncoherence of Moll Flanders; and this, combined with the extent of\\nthe critical disagreement about Defoe\\'s status as a novelist, makes\\nnecessary a fuller analysis of its total structure, and particularly of\\nthe relationship between three of its main components, plot,\\ncharacter and moral theme.\\nA brief recapitulation of the plot of Moll Flanders will make clear its\\nepisodic nature. The story falls into two main parts; the first and\\nlonger one devoted to the heroine\\'s career as a wife, and the\\nsecond to her criminal activities and their consequences. The first\\npart is composed of five main episodes, each of them ended by the\\ndeath or departure of a husband; and there are two main subepisodes,\\none of them concerning the abortive affair with a married\\nman at Bath, and the other with the stratagems whereby her friend\\nthe Redriff widow secures a mate.\\nIt is true that three of the main episodes are not wholly\\nindependent. The first marriage, closely related as it is both with\\nMoll\\'s first efforts to improve her condition and her seduction\\n114\\n-104-\\nby the Elder Brother, forms a satisfactory and indeed symbolic\\nprelude to the novel as a whole, although it has no later\\nconnection with the plot. The third marriage, with her\\nhalfbrother, leads to the discovery of the secret of her birth, and\\nthus has links both with the beginning of Moll\\'s life and with the\\nfinal scenes in Virginia where she finds him and her son again.\\nWhile the fourth marriage, to James or Jemmy, the Irish,\\nLancashire or highwayman husband (it is typical of Defoe\\'s\\nonomastic nonchalance that such copious alternative\\nidentifications should seem desirable), is connected to the later\\npart of the book from Moll\\'s trial at the Old Bailey onwards. On\\nthe other hand, although some of the plot components in the\\nfirst part are related to each other, the interlocking remains\\nrudimentary, and during long intervals it is wholly submerged in\\nthe details of Moll\\'s other activities.\\nThe second, and for many readers the most interesting, part of\\nthe book is mainly devoted to Moll\\'s career as a thief; its only\\nconnection with the rest of the plot is that it finally leads first to\\nher arrest, then to the reunion with James in prison, to her later\\ntransportation, and eventually to her return to Virginia and her\\nfamily there. Ultimately, therefore, Moll\\'s criminal adventures\\nend in a renewal of our contact with the two main episodes of\\nthe earlier half of the plot, and thus make possible a fairly neat\\nconclusion to the novel as a whole.\\nThis degree of continuity, based on the relationships between the\\nheroine, her mother, half-brother, favourite husband and only\\nsignificant child, gives Moll Flanders a degree of structural\\ncoherence which makes it unique among Defoe\\'s novels. The\\nonly comparable plot is that of Roxana, and there the unifying\\nmechanism, though simpler, is somewhat similar: a child grown\\nto maturity, relic of the seamy past, haunts the present and the\\nheroine\\'s possibilities of prosperous retirement. In neither novel,\\nhowever, does Defoe show any clear intention of winding up his\\nplot with any sense of completeness or finality. In Roxana, after\\ntaking the mother-daughter relationship with a seriousness which\\nseems to be tending to a tragic dénouement, he ends the novel\\nwith the whole matter in the air; while Moll Flanders closes in\\nsome confusion with the heroine and later her husband coming\\nback to England. Even when a resolution of the plot would seem\\nto be both easy and logical, Defoe apparently prefers and\\ncertainly achieves the inconsequential and the incomplete.\\n-105-\\n115\\nThese inconclusive endings are typical of Defoe, and in one sense\\nthey are undeniably effective; they serve as a final reminder that\\nthe order of the narrative is determined only by the sequence of\\nactual events in the lives of the protagonists. Defoe flouts the\\norderliness of literature to demonstrate his total devotion to the\\ndisorderliness of life.\\nThis unqualified allegiance to the pseudo-biographical mode goes\\nfar to explain the type of plot Defoe used. We do not know how\\nfar he was indebted to any particular formal model in writing Moll\\nFlanders, and the actual prototype of the heroine, if any, has not\\nbeen established. It is, however, quite clear that the only likely\\nanalogues of Defoe\\'s fiction are provided by some biographical\\nform of writing, that all these forms consist of a loose stringing\\ntogether of incidents in chronological sequence, and that they\\nderive whatever unity they possess from the fact that all these\\nincidents happen to the same person.\\nThe closest analogy in point of subject-matter to Moll Flanders is\\nprovided by the rogue biographies, a native tradition which was\\nmuch more exclusively devoted to realistic social documentation\\nthan were the picaresque novels. The genre had begun in\\ncompletely factual compilations, such as Thomas Harman\\'s\\nCaveat for Common Cursitors ( 1566), and had developed into a\\npartly fictional form influenced by picaresque tales and\\njestbooks. The rogue biographies are certainly episodic, but they\\nare unlike Moll Flanders as a whole in that the norms of daily life\\ntend to be lost in a welter of anecdotes concerning trickery and\\ndeception which are not particularly plausible. A similar unreality,\\nhowever, is usually to be found in those very episodes in Moll\\nFlanders which offer the closest parallel to the staple materials of\\nthe rogue biographies 1 -- episodes such as the mutual deception\\nof the heroine and her Lancashire husband, her turning the\\ntables on the mercer and getting damages for false arrest, or her\\nrhyming courtship with her half-brother, 2 a poetical tour de\\nforce which is surely not very much at home in the life history of\\na lady who shows few other signs of familiarity with the Muses.\\nThe mere fact, however, that these few incidents stand out\\n____________________\\n1 F or a study of the closest seventeenth-century analogue to\\nMoll Flanders, see Ernest Bernbaum, The Mary Carleton\\nNarratives, 1663-1673 ( Cambridge, Mass., 1914), especially\\npp. 85-90.\\n2 I , 145-158; II, 52-65; I, 77-78.\\n116\\n-106-\\nfrom the rest of Defoe\\'s narrative indicates how great the\\ndifference is between most of Moll Flanders and the rogue\\nbiographies. These incidents, like those typical of the rogue\\nbiographies, all have a contrived air: in this they resemble the\\ntraditional conception of plot in fiction, where the author chose\\nhis story because it was in some way so neat, so amusing or so\\nstriking that it stood out from the common run of experience and\\nasked to be told and retold. The novel, however, has\\ncharacteristically used a plot of a very different type, based on\\nan action which belongs wholly to ordinary experience; and it is\\non this kind of action that Moll Flanders is in the main based.\\nIt would appear, then, that Defoe\\'s plot in Moll Flanders is closer\\nto authentic biography, whether of criminals, travellers or other\\npersons, than to the semi-fictional rogue biography. It is\\ninteresting, in this connection, to note that, two years before\\nwriting Moll Flanders, Defoe compiled a more or less genuine\\nMemoir, the Life of Mr. Duncan Campbell, a well-known\\nfortuneteller, and that there he stated: \\'Of all the writings\\ndelivered in an historical manner to the world, none certainly\\nwere ever held in greater esteem than those which give us the\\nlives of distinguished private men at full length; and, as I may\\nsay, to the life\\'. 1 Defoe\\'s high regard for genuine biography is\\nreflected in the way his own novels always pass themselves off\\nas authentic autobiography. This alone would involve the type of\\nnarrative structure he used: he had only to absorb himself\\ncompletely in his own make-believe that Moll Flanders was the\\nlife of a real person, and an episodic but life-like plot sequence\\nwas inevitable. It is unlikely that Defoe ever reflected on the\\nother literary consequences of such a plot; if he did, he was\\nprobably quite content to sacrifice whatever formal disabilities\\nmight ensue in exchange for the absolute authenticity which they\\nmade possible, and indeed relatively easy.\\nThe disabilities are obvious and serious. Aristotle thought that\\nthe episodic plot whose unity depends only on its being the\\nhistory of one character was the worst kind of plot, because\\n\\'there are many actions of one man which cannot be made to\\nform one action; and also because history is concerned with what\\nactually happened, as opposed to poetry which deals with the\\nprobable or necessary\\'. 2 It may be that in the novel these\\nobjections are not final, but there is much to be said for the\\n____________________\\n117\\n1\\' T he Introduction.\\'\\n2 P oetics, 8, 9.\\n-107-\\nview that, on the contrary, Defoe\\'s concentration on producing\\npseudo-history, although a crucial step in the development of the\\nkind of plot suited to the novel\\'s formal realism, was so exclusive\\nthat the other ends of fiction, the ends of poetry in Aristotle\\'s\\nsense, were inevitably crowded out of the picture. Inevitably,\\nbecause the disabilities that ensue from an episodic plot do not\\nend there, but deny Defoe the advantages of a structure which\\nwill give coherence and larger implication to the thoughts and\\nacts of his characters.\\nMoll Flanders is certainly, as E. M. Forster says, a novel of\\ncharacter; 1 the plot throws the whole burden of interest on the\\nheroine, and many readers have felt that she supports it\\ntriumphantly. On the other hand, Leslie Stephen has reproached\\nDefoe with a lack of \\'all that goes by the name of psychological\\nanalysis in modern fiction\\', 2 and not altogether without\\njustification, at least if our emphasis is on the word analysis.\\nThere is probably no episode in Moll Flanders where the\\nmotivation is unconvincing, but for somewhat damaging reasons\\n-- few of the situations confronting Defoe\\'s heroine call for any\\nmore complex discriminations than those of Pavlov\\'s dog: Defoe\\nmakes us admire the speed and resolution of Moll\\'s reactions to\\nprofit or danger; and if there are no detailed psychological\\nanalyses, it is because they would be wholly superfluous.\\nThere are two main ways in which later novelists have\\nmanifested their powers of psychological understanding:\\nindirectly, by revealing the character\\'s personality through his\\nactions; or directly, by specific analysis of the character\\'s various\\nstates of mind. Both these methods, of course, can be and\\nusually are combined; and they are usually found in conjunction\\nwith a narrative structure designed to embody the character\\'s\\ndevelopment, and to present him with crucial moral choices\\nwhich bring his whole personality into play. There is very little of\\nthese things in Moll Flanders. Defoe does not so much portray his\\nheroine\\'s character as assume its reality in every action, and\\ncarry his reader with him -- if we accede to the reality of the\\ndeed, it is difficult to challenge the reality of the doer. It is only\\nwhen we attempt to fit all her acts together, and see them as an\\nexpression of a single personality, that doubts arise; nor are\\n____________________\\n118\\n1 A spects of the Novel, p. 61.\\n2 \" \\'Defoe\\'s Novels\\'\", p. 17.\\n-108-\\nthese doubts allayed when we discover how little we are told\\nabout some of the things we should need to know for a full\\npicture of her personality, and how some of the things we are\\ntold seem contradictory.\\nThese deficiencies are especially apparent in Defoe\\'s treatment of\\npersonal relationships. We are told very little, for example, about\\nthe quality of Moll Flanders\\'s loves, and even our information\\nabout their quantity is suspiciously meagre. When she accuses\\nherself of having \\'lain with thirteen men\\', we cannot but resent\\nthe fact that some six lovers have been hidden not only from her\\nfifth husband, but, much more unforgiveably, from us. Even\\namong those lovers we know, we cannot be sure which Moll\\npreferred. We have a strong impression that James is her\\nfavourite, and that she leaves him for the fifth or banking one\\nonly out of dire economic necessity; yet she tells us that on her\\nhoneymoon with the latter she \\'never lived four pleasanter days\\ntogether\\', and that five years of an \\'uninterrupted course of ease\\nand content\\' ensued. When James later reappears, however, our\\nearlier impression recurs with renewed force:\\nHe turned pale, and stood speechless, like one thunderstruck,\\nand, not able to conquer the surprise, said no more but this, \\'Let\\nme sit down\\'; and sitting down by a table, he laid his elbow on\\nthe table, and leaning his head on his hand, fixed his eyes on the\\nground as one stupid. I cried so vehemently, on the other hand,\\nthat it was a good while ere I could speak any more; but after I\\nhad given some vent to my passion by tears, I repeated the\\nsame words, \\'My dear, do you not know me?\\' At which he\\nanswered, Yes, and said no more a good while. 1\\nDefoe\\'s laconic narrative manner could be supremely evocative\\nwhen it was focussed on personal relationships, but this\\nhappened rather rarely, probably because neither Defoe nor Moll\\nFlanders conceived of such intangible concerns as important and\\ncontinuing elements in human life. We are certainly given very\\nlittle help in understanding Moll\\'s conflicting feelings during her\\nmarriage with the banker. Like the first two husbands, he is\\nindividualised only to the extent of being given an ordinal\\nnumber; and Moll\\'s life with him is treated as a brief and wholly\\nself-contained episode whose emotional premise\\n119\\n____________________\\n1 I , 190, 196, 197; II, 113-114.\\n-109-\\ndoes not have to be reconciled with other features of her life and\\ncharacter. Defoe, indeed, emphasises this discontinuity by telling\\nus that James wrote three times to Moll at this time suggesting\\nthat they go off to Virginia as she had earlier proposed, 1 but\\nonly after the fifth husband has been long dead: another novelist\\nwould have made such pleas an opportunity for clarifying his\\nheroine\\'s conflicting feelings towards the two men, but Defoe\\ngives us only the bare facts, long after they have lost their\\npotential power for psychological illumination.\\nIf we attempt to draw any conclusion from Defoe\\'s treatment of\\nthese particular personal relationships it must surely be that Moll\\nFlanders was unaffectedly happy with both husbands, and that\\nalthough her love of one of them was deeper, she did not allow\\nthis sentiment to interfere with the solid comforts which the\\nother was able to provide. She is, obviously, affectionate but no\\nsentimentalist. We get a somewhat different picture, however,\\nwhen we come to consider her character, not as a wife, but as a\\nmother. On the one hand, she can behave with complete\\nsentimental abandon, as when she kisses the ground her\\nlongseparated son Humphry has been standing on; on the other\\nhand, although she shows some fondness for two or three of her\\nchildren, she is by normal standards somewhat callous in her\\ntreatment of most of them -- the majority are mentioned only to\\nbe forgotten, and, once left in the care of relatives or\\nfostermothers, are neither redeemed subsequently nor even\\ninquired after when opportunity permits. Here the conclusion\\nabout her character must surely be that, although there are\\nextenuating circumstances, she is often a heartless mother. It is\\ndifficult to see how this can be reconciled either with her kissing\\nthe ground that Humphry has trodden, or with the fact that she\\nherself loudly condemns unnatural mothers, 2 but never makes\\nany such accusation against herself even in her deepest\\nmoments of penitent self-reprobation.\\nOne explanation of this apparent contradiction would make it a\\nmatter, not of psychological understanding but of literary\\ntechnique: briefly that in reading Defoe we must posit a kind of\\nlimited liability for the narrative, accepting whatever is\\nspecifically stated, but drawing no inferences from omissions,\\nhowever significant they may seem. If Moll Flanders does not\\n111\\nseem to\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 117.\\n2 I , 180-183.\\n-110-\\nregret James during her fifth marital career, this is only because\\nDefoe did not conceive of the attitudes of characters to each\\nother as enduring realities on which his narrative technique\\nshould focus. If Moll Flanders is silent about the eventual fate of\\nall her children except Humphry and the four reported dead, we\\nmust not infer that she is without proper maternal feeling, but\\nonly that Defoe did not keep his characters in mind when they\\nwere off the stage. In both cases, in fact, our interpretation\\nshould not be allowed to go beyond what is positively stated by\\nDefoe or Moll Flanders.\\nThere is also another explanation for the lack of full evidence\\nfrom which to deduce Moll Flanders\\'s personality through her\\nconduct of personal relations: the fact that the criminal\\nindividualism which Moll pursues in her later days tends to\\nminimise the importance of personal relationships. Like the other\\ninhabitants of the criminal milieu, she has to assume false names\\nand false identities, and much of her life is devoted to\\nmaintaining these pretences. Nearly all her personal contacts,\\ntherefore, are coloured by this role; they can never be deep or\\nunreserved, and they are necessarily transitory in a sense,\\ntherefore Defoe is being realistic when he portrays the personal\\nrelationships of Moll Flanders as a series of essentially casual\\nencounters, very like those of the real vagrants and criminals\\ndescribed by Mayhew in the next century. Here is one such\\nreport:\\nIn the morning I was turned out [from a union], and after I had\\nleft I picked up with a young woman who had slept in the union\\novernight. I said I was going on the road across country to\\nBirmingham, and I axed her to go with me. I had never seen her\\nbefore. She consented and we went along together begging our\\nway. . . . I lost the young woman when I was put in prison in\\nManchester. She never came to see me in quod. She cared\\nnothing for me. She only kept company with me to have\\nsomeone on the road along with her; and I didn\\'t care for her,\\nnot I. 1\\nThe laconic authenticity of this passage is very similar to that of\\n111\\nDefoe, and it typifies the desultory nature of personal relations in\\nthe criminal milieu. This milieu, indeed, has effects on personal\\nrelations not unlike those which economic individualism produces\\nin Robinson Crusoe; Mayhew\\'s vagrant, Moll,\\n____________________\\n1 M ayhew\\'s Characters, ed. Quennell ( London, 1951), pp. 294-\\n296.\\n-111-\\nand most of Defoe\\'s other characters all belong on Crusoe\\'s\\nisland; essentially solitary, they take a severely functional view\\nof their fellows.\\nNeither Defoe\\'s narrative focus, then, nor the nature of his\\nsubject, is such as to reveal Moll\\'s personality through the part\\nshe plays in personal relationships. This does not in itself\\nundermine the plausibility of Defoe\\'s presentation of his heroine\\'s\\npsychology: some of the apparent discrepancies noted above are\\nmainly negative -- the result of lack of information: while the\\nbasic difficulty might reasonably be resolved by assuming that\\nMoll Flanders is naturally warm-hearted but that circumstances\\noften force her to play a lone hand. The very fact that Moll\\nFlanders has no stable setting in personal relationships, however,\\npresents considerable difficulties in determining whether this is\\nso. Usually when we attempt to make up our minds about\\nanyone\\'s total personality we take into account as many views\\nabout the person as possible, and by comparing them with our\\nown are able to achieve a kind of stereoscopic effect.\\nNo such enlightenment is forthcoming on Defoe\\'s heroine. The\\nepisodic nature of the plot means that, although there are some\\ntwo hundred characters in Moll Flanders, no one of them knows\\nthe heroine for more than a fraction of her career; while the\\nautobiographical mode of presentation means that their attitudes\\nto Moll Flanders are only given to us if and how she wishes. Their\\nevidence actually reveals a unanimity of a very suspect kind --\\nDefoe\\'s heroine apparently excites in those best qualified to\\njudge her -- James, the Governess, Humphry, for instance -- the\\nmost unqualified and selfless devotion. On the other hand, the\\nreader, observing that Moll Flanders herself is never wholly\\nhonest and disinterested in her dealings with them, or indeed\\nwith anyone else, may well feel inclined to interpret their\\napparent adoration as evidence of a paranoid delusion on Moll\\nFlanders\\'s part rather than as an accurate appraisal of her\\ncharacter on theirs. Everyone seems to exist only for her, and no\\n112\\none seems to resent it. One might have expected the Governess,\\nfor example, to regret Moll\\'s reformation since it deprives her of\\na prize source of stolen goods; instead, she becomes \\'a true\\npenitent\\' 1 as soon as the heroine has no further use for her\\nservices.\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 102.\\n-112-\\nIf none of those close to Moll Flanders seem at all aware of her\\ntrue character, and if we continue to suspect that her own\\naccount of herself may be partial, our only remaining resource\\nfor an objective view of her personality is Defoe himself. Here\\nagain, however, we at once encounter difficulties. For Moll\\nFlanders is suspiciously like her author, even in matters where\\nwe would expect striking and obvious differences. The facts show\\nthat she is a woman and a criminal, for example; but neither of\\nthese roles determines her personality as Defoe has drawn it.\\nMoll Flanders, of course, has many feminine traits; she has a\\nkeen eye for fine clothes and clean linen, and shows a wifely\\nconcern for the creature comforts of her males. Further, the\\nearly pages of the book undoubtedly present a young girl with a\\nlifelike clarity, and later there are many touches of a rough\\ncockney humour that is undeniably feminine in tone. But these\\nare relatively external and minor matters, and the essence of her\\ncharacter and actions is, to one reader at least, essentially\\nmasculine. This is a personal impression, and would be difficult,\\nif not impossible, to establish: but it is at least certain that Moll\\naccepts none of the disabilities of her sex, and indeed one cannot\\nbut feel that Virginia Woolf\\'s admiration for her was largely due\\nto admiration of a heroine who so fully realised one of the ideals\\nof feminism: freedom from any involuntary involvement in the\\nfeminine role.\\nMoll Flanders is also similar to her author in another respect: she\\nseems fundamentally untouched by her criminal background,\\nand, on the contrary, displays many of the attitudes of a virtuous\\nand public-minded citizen. Here, again, there is no glaring\\ninconsistency, but there is a marked pattern of attitudes which\\ndistinguishes Moll from other members of her class: in the\\npassage quoted above she showed no fellow-feeling for the boy\\npickpocket; later she is full of virtuous indignation at the\\n\\'hardened wretches\\' of Newgate, and they repay in kind by\\nhooting at her derisively; and when finally she is transported she\\n113\\nhas the satisfaction of observing, from her privileged comfort in\\nthe captain\\'s quarters, that the \\'old fraternity\\' are \\'kept under\\nhatches\\'. 1 Moll Flanders obviously places criminals into two\\nclasses: most of them are vicious reprobates who richly deserve\\ntheir fate; but she and a few of her friends are essentially\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 90, 112, 90; I, 62-63; II, 134.\\n-113-\\nvirtuous and deserving people who have been unfortunate -- she\\nis even morally pure in her whoring since it is, as she assures us,\\nby necessity and not \\'for the sake of the vice\\'. 1 Like Defoe, in\\nfact, she is a good Puritan who, despite a few necessary and\\nregrettable compromises, has, in the main and in defiance of\\nillustrious precedent, lived in a world of pitch and not been\\ndefiled.\\nIt is this freedom from the probable psychological and social\\nconsequences of everything she does which is the central\\nimplausibility of her character as Defoe has drawn it. It applies,\\nnot only to her crimes, but to everything she does. If we take the\\nincest theme, for example, we find that although her halfbrother\\nbecomes incapable in body and mind mainly because Moll\\nFlanders has left him, after revealing her terrible secret, she\\nherself is quite unaffected by the circumstance, once she has left\\nVirginia. Nor are her son\\'s feelings towards her influenced,\\napparently, by the fact that he is the offspring of an incestuous\\nmarriage; nor even by the fact that his mother, after deserting\\nhim for some twenty years, only returns because, having been\\ntransported back to his vicinity, she thinks that she may now\\nhave an estate to inherit, an estate which he would otherwise\\nenjoy.\\nMoll Flanders\\'s character, then, is not noticeably affected either\\nby her sex, by her criminal pursuits, or indeed by any of the\\nobjective factors which might have been expected to set her\\napart from her author; on the other hand, she shares with Defoe\\nand most of his heroes many of the character traits that are\\nusually regarded as middle-class. She is obsessed with gentility\\nand keeping up appearances; her pride is much involved in\\nknowing how to get good service and proper accommodation;\\nand she is in her heart a rentier, for whom life has no greater\\nterror than when her \\'main stock wastes apace\\'. 2 More\\nspecifically it is apparent that, like Robinson Crusoe, she has, by\\nsome process of osmosis, picked up the vocabulary and attitudes\\n114\\nof a tradesman. Indeed her most positive qualities are the same\\nas Crusoe\\'s, a restless, amoral and strenuous individualism. It is,\\nno doubt, possible to argue that these qualities might be found in\\na character of her sex, station and personal vicissitudes; but it is\\nnot likely, and it is surely more reasonable to assume that all\\nthese contradictions are the consequence of a process to\\n____________________\\n1 I , 131, 139.\\n2 I , 131.\\n-114-\\nwhich first-person narration is peculiarly prone; that Defoe\\'s\\nidentification with Moll Flanders was so complete that, despite a\\nfew feminine traits, he created a personality that was in essence\\nhis own.\\nThe hypothesis of the unconscious identification between Defoe\\nand his heroine seems equally valid when we come to analyse\\nthe third aspect of the total structure of Moll Flanders --lb /> its\\nlarger moral significance.\\nThe \\'Author\\'s Preface\\' states that \\'there is not a wicked action in\\nany part of it, but is first or last rendered unhappy or\\nunfortunate\\'. This moral claim for Moll Flanders amounts only to\\nthe assertion that it teaches a somewhat narrow kind of ethical\\nlesson -- vice must be paid for and crime does not pay. Even\\nthis, however, is not substantiated by the narrative itself. What\\nseems to have happened is that Defoe succumbed to the eternal\\ndanger of the crime story: to be interesting the author has to\\nproject himself as completely as possible into the mind of the\\ncrook, but, having once donned the colours of crime, he plays to\\nwin. Defoe cannot bear to let Moll Flanders come on evil days.\\nHer fortunes vary, it is true; but she never falls so low as to be\\nforced to break her early resolve never to \\'work housework\\', 1\\nand she retains her middle-class status even in prison. For the\\nmost part, whether as wife, mistress or thief, she is exceptionally\\nsuccessful, and when the crash comes she saves enough of her\\nill-gotten gains to stock a plantation and yet retain a\\nconsiderable balance in England.\\nMoll\\'s penitent prosperity, then, is based on her criminal career,\\nand the sincerity of her reformation is never put to the acid test\\nof sacrificing material for moral good. The plot, in fact, flatly\\ncontradicts Defoe\\'s purported moral theme.\\n115\\nIt remains conceivable, however, that some other kinds of moral\\nsignificance could have been embodied in the narrative,\\npresumably by other means than those of the implications of the\\nplot. Defoe, for example, might have used direct editorial\\ncommentary to force the reader to see his protagonist from the\\nproper viewpoint by drawing attention to her inveterate\\nselfishness and the superficiality of her repentance. Such\\neditorial intrusion, however, would have interfered with Defoe\\'s\\nprimary purpose, that of giving the impression that Moll Flanders\\nis a\\n____________________\\n1 I , 4-6.\\n-115-\\nliteral and authentic autobiography, and the method was\\ntherefore unacceptable.\\nWhatever moral significance Defoe wished to attach to his story,\\ntherefore, had to spring directly from the moral consciousness of\\nhis heroine. This meant that she had to function both as a\\ncharacter and as an editorial mouthpiece and she therefore had\\nto recount the story from the perspective of her later penitence.\\nThis also involved difficulties; partly because Moll\\'s loves and\\nlarcenies would obviously lose most of their attraction for the\\nreader if they were too heavily sprinkled with the ashes of\\nrepentance; and partly because such a perspective called for a\\nvery rigorous separation in time between the consciousness that\\nhad performed the evil deeds and the reformed consciousness\\nthat was responsible for their redaction.\\nDefoe\\'s unawareness of these problems is suggested by the way\\nhis \\'Author\\'s Preface\\' evades the crucial issue of the relation of\\nthe novel to Moll\\'s \\'own memorandums\\', which it was allegedly\\n\\'written from\\'. The \\'pen employed in finishing her story\\' mentions\\na \\'copy which first came to hand\\' and which needed much\\nbowdlerising to \\'make it speak language fit to be read\\'; but the\\nexistence is also inferred of later, and presumably chaster,\\ndocuments which showed Moll \\'grown humble and penitent, as\\nshe afterwards pretends to be\\'. On these, however, Defoe is\\nsilent, and we therefore cannot tell which -- if any -- of the moral\\nand religious reflections in the text were actually made by the\\nheroine, nor at what period in her life.\\nThis irresolution about the time scale is sometimes apparent\\neven in the wording of the penitent reflections. It is evident, for\\n116\\ninstance, that one of Moll\\'s earliest and not altogether venial sins\\nis that of bigamy: she is not divorced from her second husband\\nand there is no report of his death; her later amorous career,\\ntherefore, is one of cumulative bigamy interspersed with\\nadultery. The problem, however, only enters her moral\\nconsciousness once, when she is conscience-stricken by her Bath\\ngallant\\'s determination not to continue their \\'unhappy\\ncorrespondence\\'. She writes: \\'But I never once reflected that I\\nwas all this while a married woman, a wife to Mr. B -----, the\\nlinen draper, who, though he had left me by the necessity of his\\ncircumstances, had no power to discharge me from the marriage\\ncontract which was between us, or to give me a legal liberty to\\nmarry again; so that I had been no less a whore and adultress\\n-116-\\nall this while. I then reproached myself with the liberties I had\\ntaken, and how I had been a snare to this gentleman. . . .\\' 1\\nAt first sight this passage appears to be the reflection made by a\\npenitent Moll looking back on her former heedlessness; if so, one\\ncannot but doubt the rigour of her spiritual scrutiny, since there\\nare no such reflections about the two later -- and equally\\nbigamous -- marriages. If, however, we look at the passage\\nagain it becomes evident that the point cannot be pursued\\nbecause there is a real confusion about the time at which the\\nreflection is supposed to be made. In writing \\'I then reproached\\nmyself\\', \\'then\\' surely implies that Moll Flanders reproached\\nherself at the time the event occurred; if this is so, she or her\\nauthor have surely forgotten that the original time status of the\\nparagraph, which begins \\'I never once reflected\\', implied that the\\nmoral reflections were made long after the event when remorse\\nhad finally supervened.\\nDefoe, then, failed to locate his didactic commentary\\nconvincingly in any particular period of his heroine\\'s moral\\ndevelopment; and this may stand as an example of his general\\nfailure to resolve the formal problems to which his moral purpose\\nand his autobiographical narrative mode committed him. One\\nreason for this is no doubt that Defoe did not give either his art\\nor his conscience the searching attention which his moral aims\\ninvolved; on the other hand, we must remember that he was in\\nfact faced with a problem which was then new and has since\\nremained the central problem of the novel: how to impose a\\ncoherent moral structure on narrative without detracting from its\\nair of literal authenticity.\\n117\\nFormal realism is only a mode of presentation, and it is therefore\\nethically neutral: all Defoe\\'s novels are also ethically neutral\\nbecause they make formal realism an end rather than a means,\\nsubordinating any coherent ulterior significance to the illusion\\nthat the text represents the authentic lucubrations of an\\nhistorical person. But the individual case-book is an arid study\\nexcept in the hands of a skilled interrogator who can elicit the\\nthings we want to know, which are often the very things the\\nperson concerned does not know or is unwilling to admit: the\\nproblem of the novel was to discover and reveal these deeper\\nmeanings without any breach of formal realism.\\nLater novelists were to see that although formal realism\\n____________________\\n1 I , 126-127.\\n-117-\\nimposed a more absolute and impersonal optical accuracy upon\\nthe manner in which literature performed its ancient task of\\nholding the mirror up to nature, there were nevertheless ways in\\nwhich a moral pattern could be conveyed, although they were\\nperhaps more difficult and indirect than those of previous literary\\nforms. For, in place of direct comment, or the power of tone and\\nimagery, the pattern had to depend upon the manipulation of the\\nmirror in time, in place, in closeness, in brilliance. \\'Point of view\\'\\nwas to become the crucial instrument whereby the writer\\nexpressed his moral sensibility, and pattern came to be the\\nresult of the hidden skill whereby the angles at which the mirror\\nwas held were made to reflect reality as the novelist saw it. No\\nsuch pattern emerges from Defoe\\'s treatment of plot and\\ncharacterisation in Moll Flanders; as for the moral consciousness\\nof his heroine, it continues to elude us in the infinite regress\\nproduced by the lack of co-ordination between the different\\naspects of his narrative purpose.\\nIII\\nThose who, like John Peale Bishop, see Moll Flanders as \\'one of\\nthe great English novels, perhaps the greatest\\', 1 can hardly fail\\nto notice this lack of co-ordination, but they discern behind it a\\nfirm grasp on the realities of human behaviour. As to the\\nmoralising, they assume that Defoe cannot have meant it\\nseriously, and that the story belongs to that class of novel where\\nthe discrepancy between the apparent moral tenor and any\\nintelligent understanding of it by the reader is a literary device\\n118\\nby which the author tells us that his work must be interpreted\\nironically: the method may be called that of the conspicuous\\nabsence of authorial endorsement from first-person narration,\\nand it has certainly been used successfully in such modern\\nanalogues of Moll Flanders as Anita Loos\\'s Gentlemen Prefer\\nBlondes and Joyce Cary\\'s Herself Surprised.\\nTo read Moll Flanders in this way would imply that Defoe was\\nquite separate from his creation, that he did not even intend the\\nmoral asseverations of the preface seriously, and that on the\\ncontrary he was unrepentantly delighted with his depiction of the\\nsubversive and ironic counterpoint between material and moral\\nconsiderations which is the most conspicuous feature of\\n____________________\\n1 C ollected Essays, ed. Wilson ( New York, 1948), p. 388.\\n-118-\\nthe novel to the modern reader. This interpretation, though\\nconsistent with a good deal of the present analysis, is in essence\\ndiametrically opposed to it: nevertheless it has received wide\\nenough recent support to demand further examination.\\nPerhaps the most famous claim made for Defoe as an artist was\\nmade by Coleridge, in a marginal note on the passage in\\nRobinson Grusoe where the hero comes across some gold in the\\ncabin of the wreck:\\nI smil\\'d to my self at the Sight of this Money, O Drug! Said I\\naloud, what are thou good for, Thou are not worth to me, no not\\nthe taking off of the Ground, one of those Knives is worth all this\\nHeap, I have no Manner of use for thee, e\\'en remain where thou\\nart, and go to the Bottom as a Creature whose Life is not worth\\nsaving. However, upon Second Thoughts, I took it away;* and\\nwrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas...\\nSo Defoe, and at the asterisk Coleridge commented:\\nWorthy of Shakespeare; -- and yet the simple semi-colon after it,\\ntile instant passing on without the least pause of reflex\\nconsciousness is more exquisite and masterlike than the touch\\nitself. A meaner writer, a Marmontel, would have put an \\'!\\' after\\n\\'away\\', and have commenced a new paragraph. 1\\nWe smile at the phrase \\'on second thoughts\\', with its casual\\ndeflation of Crusoe\\'s rhetorical paradox about the worthlessness\\n119\\nof gold, and are tempted to see a fine literary decorum in Defoe\\'s\\navoidance of any further explanation of the compulsive\\nirrationality of economic man. Yet, can we be sure that the irony\\nis not accidental? Is this paradoxical monologue really suited to\\nCrusoe\\'s character or his present situation? Isn\\'t it more typical\\nof Defoe the economic publicist ever on the alert to enforce the\\nuseful truth that goods alone constitute real wealth? And if so --\\nisn\\'t the apparent irony merely the result of the extreme\\ninsouciance with which Defoe the publicist jerks himself back to\\nhis role as novelist, and hastens to tell us what he knows Crusoe,\\nand indeed anyone else, would actually do in the circumstances?\\nWe certainly cannot allow Coleridge\\'s praise to pass as it stands.\\nHe used the 1812 edition of the book, which -- like most later\\neditions -- had put a good deal of order into Defoe\\'s\\n____________________\\n1 M iscellaneous Criticism, ed. Raysor ( London, 1936), p. 294.\\n-119-\\nhaphazard punctuation: the early editions actually give a comma,\\nnot a semi-colon, after \\'I took it away\\'. Further -Coleridge\\'s case\\nfor Defoe\\'s literary mastery depends a great deal on Defoe\\'s\\nhaving first combined the two components of the irony -- the\\nuselessness of gold in the circumstances, and the decision to\\ntake it nevertheless -- into a single unit of meaning, and on his\\nhaving then refused to give any obvious signal to the reader,\\nsuch as an exclamation mark. In fact, however, not only is there\\na comma for Coleridge\\'s semi-colon, but there are lots of others\\nas the sentence rambles on for some fifteen lines, during which\\nCrusoe swims ashore and a storm blows up. This seems to be\\nhiding the effect a little too much: and suggests that the real\\nreason for the semblance of irony here and elsewhere in Defoe\\nmay well be the amount of heterogeneous matter which he\\nhabitually aggregates into one syntactical unit, together with the\\nextreme casualness by which the transitions between the\\ndisparate items are effected.\\nColeridge\\'s enthusiasm may in any case serve to remind us of\\nthe danger to which, it has been alleged, the wise are especially\\nprone: that of seeing too much. This seems to be what happens\\nin Virginia Woolf\\'s two essays in the Common Reader. Do not the\\ntexts of Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders provide her with an\\noccasion for being wise, for seeing more than is really there? She\\nwrites, for instance, of \\'a plain earthenware pot stands in the\\nforeground... [which]... persuades us to see remote islands and\\n121\\nthe solitudes of the human soul\\'. 1 In view of the essay \\'On\\nSolitude\\' in the last part of Robinson Crusoe it is surely more\\nlikely that Defoe\\'s technique was not subtle or conscious enough\\nto be able to evoke the theme of human solitude and to instruct\\nus in elementary pottery at the same time and in the same\\nnarrative.\\nSo when Virginia Woolf writes of Defoe subduing \\'every other\\nelement to his design\\' 2 I remain sceptical. Is there -- either in\\nRobinson Crusoe or in Moll Flanders -- any design whatsoever in\\nthe usual sense of the term? Isn\\'t such an interpretation really a\\nkind of indirect critical repayment for the feeling of superiority\\nwhich Defoe enables us to derive from his humble and\\nunpondered prose, a feeling of superiority which enables us to\\nconvert the extreme cases of his narrative gaucherie into irony?\\n____________________\\n1 \" \\'Robinson Crusoe\\'\", The Common Reader, Second Series (\\nLondon, 1948), p. 58.\\n2 I bid.\\n-120-\\nMoll Flanders has a few examples of patent and conscious irony.\\nThere is, first of all, a good deal of dramatic irony of a simple\\nkind: for example in Virginia, where a woman relates the story of\\nMoll\\'s incestuous marriage, not knowing that she is addressing\\nits chief figure. 1 There are also some examples of much more\\npointed irony, as in the passage when, as a little girl, Moll\\nFlanders vows that she will become a gentlewoman when she\\ngrows up, like one of her leisured but scandalous neighbours:\\n\\'Poor child,\\' says my good old nurse, \\'you may soon be such a\\ngentlewoman as that, for she is a person of ill fame, and has had\\ntwo bastards.\\'\\nI did not understand anything of that; but I answered, \\'I am sure\\nthey call her madam, and she does not go to service nor do\\nhousework\\'; and therefore I insisted that she was a\\ngentlewoman, and I would be such a gentlewoman as that. 2\\nIt is good dramatic irony to point this prophetic episode with the\\nphrase \\'such a gentlewoman as that\\', where the verbal emphasis\\nalso drives home the difference between virtue and class, and\\nthe moral dangers of being taken in by external evidences of\\ngentility. We can be certain that the irony is conscious because\\nits tenor is supported by Defoe\\'s other writings, which often\\n121\\nshow a somewhat rancorous spirit towards the failure of the\\ngentry to provide proper models of conduct: there is a similar\\ntendency, for example, in Moll\\'s later ironical description of the\\neldest brother as \\'a gay gentleman who... had levity enough to\\ndo an ill-natured thing, yet had too much judgment of things to\\npay too dear for his pleasures\\'. Here, the combination of stylistic\\nelegance and demonstrable consonance with Defoe\\'s own point\\nof view makes us sure that Moll Flanders\\'s reflection after she\\nhas been duped by James is also ironical: \"Tis something of relief\\neven to be undone by a man of honour, rather than by a\\nscoundrel\\'. 3 The verbal hyperbole drives home the contrast\\nbetween overt and actual moral norms: \\'undone\\' is a calculated\\nexaggeration, Moll Flanders being what she is already; and the\\nambiguity of \\'a man of honour\\' seems to be used with full\\nconsciousness of its subversive effect.\\nThese examples of conscious irony in Moll Flanders, however,\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 142.\\n2 I I, 8.\\n3 I , 14, 155.\\n-121-\\nfall far short of the larger, structural irony which would suggest\\nthat Defoe viewed either his central character or his purported\\nmoral theme ironically. There is certainly nothing in Moll Flanders\\nwhich clearly indicates that Defoe sees the story differently from\\nthe heroine. There are, it is true, a few cases where such an\\nintention seems possible: but on examination they are seen to\\nhave none of the hallmarks of the conscious examples of irony\\ngiven above; instead, they are much closer to the passage in\\nRobinson Crusoe.\\nA particularly close parallel to Crusoe\\'s bathetic fall from his\\nrhetorical climax occurs after Moll Flanders has revealed the\\nterrible truth of her birth to her husband and half-brother:\\nI saw him turn pale and look wild; and I said, \\'Now remember\\nyour promise, and receive it with presence of mind; for who\\ncould have said more to prepare you for it than I have done?\\'\\nHowever, I called a servant, and got him a little glass of rum\\n(which is the usual dram of the country), for he was fainting\\naway. 1\\nThe insistence on credibility -- leading to the fussy parenthesis\\n122\\nexplaining why rum and not brandy -- creates a violent contrast\\nbetween the great stress of the emotion and its very humdrum\\ncure. Life, one might agree, is like that; but any writer who\\nwanted to insist on the intensity of the emotion would not\\nsuggest that a glass of rum would meet the case. Especially a\\nlittle one -- \\'little\\' is a good example of how a \\'realistic\\' attention\\nto minute but somehow inappropriate detail can help to create\\nirony.\\nFormally, we notice, the passage is similar to the gold one; the\\ntransition between the incongruous elements uses the\\nadversative \\'however\\' which insists on the logical connection in\\nthe narrator\\'s mind. If Defoe had merely begun a new\\nparagraph, the irony would have been much diminished, since it\\ndepends on the apparent insistence that the two juxtaposed\\nitems -- in each case an emotional or abstract extreme followed\\nby a more practical consideration -- really belong to the same\\nuniverse of discourse.\\nThe passage is also typical in content, because the suspicion of\\nirony is aroused by a bathetic transition from sentiment to action\\nwhich is very common in Defoe\\'s novels, although it is never\\ncertain that he intends it ironically. There is the occasion,\\n____________________\\n1 I , 103.\\n-122-\\nfor instance, when Moll, in her unwonted transport of feeling,\\nkisses the ground her son has trodden on, but desists as soon as\\nit is urged upon her that the ground is \\'damp and dangerous\\'. 1\\nIt is perhaps possible that Defoe was laughing at his heroine\\'s\\nunabashed mixture of sentimentality and common sense; but it\\nis surely more likely that he had to get Moll off her knees before\\nhe could get on with the story, and that he did not ponder the\\nmeans of doing so very carefully.\\nThe lack of insulation between incongruous attitudes seems\\nparticularly ironical if we are already predisposed to regard one\\nof them as false. This happens with many of the moralising\\npassages, and Defoe certainly does nothing to obviate our\\nincredulity by the way he introduces them. One glaringly\\nimprobable case occurs when an as yet impenitent Moll relates to\\nthe governess how she was picked up by a drunken man whom\\nshe later robbed, and goes on to improve the occasion by\\nquoting Solomon in the course of a lay sermon against\\n123\\ndrunkenness. The governess is much moved, Moll tells us:\\n. . . it so affected her that she was hardly able to forbear tears,\\nto think how such a gentleman ran a daily risk of being undone,\\nevery time a glass of wine got into his head.\\nBut as to the purchase I got, and how entirely I stripped him,\\nshe told me it pleased her wonderfully. \\'Nay, child,\\' says she,\\n\\'the usage may, for aught I know, do more to reform him than\\nall the sermons that ever he will hear in his life.\\' And if the\\nremainder of the story be true, so it did. 2\\nThe two women then combine to anticipate divine retribution,\\nand to milk the poor gentleman of his cash, in order to drive\\ntheir lesson home. The episode is certainly a travesty of piety\\nand morality; and yet it is very unlikely that Defoe is being\\nironical; any more than he is later when, by some very human\\nobliquity, Moll Flanders excuses herself from the prison chaplain\\'s\\nappeal that she confess her sins on the grounds of his addiction\\nto the bottle. 3 Both episodes are plausible enough\\npsychologically: the devotees of one vice are often less\\ncharitable than the virtuous about the other ones they happen\\nnot to favour. The problem, however, is whether Defoe himself\\noverlooked, and expected his readers to overlook, the very\\ndamaging nature of the context in which his homilies against\\nalcohol occur.\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 141.\\n2 I I, 37-38.\\n3 I I, 93.\\n-123-\\nThere is every reason to believe that he did: the lesson itself\\nmust have been intended seriously, and not ironically; as for its\\ncontext, we have already seen that there was no way in which\\nDefoe could make good his didactic professions except by\\nmaking Moll double as chorus for his own honest beliefs; and\\nthere is therefore good reason to believe that the moral\\nimperceptiveness which is so laughably clear to us is in fact a\\nreflection of one of the psychological characteristics of Puritanism\\nwhich Defoe shared with his heroine.\\nSvend Ranulf, in his Moral Indignation and Middle Class\\nPsychology, has shown, mainly from Commonwealth pamphlets,\\nhow the Puritans were much more addicted to outbursts of moral\\n124\\nindignation than were the Royalists., 1 One of the strengths of\\nPuritanism, he suggests, lay in its tendency to convert its\\ndemand for righteousness into a somewhat uncharitable\\naggressiveness against the sins of others: and this, of course,\\ncarried with it a complementary tendency for the individual to be\\nmercifully blind to his own faults. Moll Flanders frequently\\nexemplifies this tendency. One famous instance is the passage\\nwhen she consoles herself for having stolen a child\\'s gold\\nnecklace with the reflection: \\'I only thought I had given the\\nparents a just reproof for their negligence, in leaving the poor\\nlamb to come home by itself, and it would teach them to take\\nmore care another time\\'. 2 There is no doubt about the\\npsychological veracity of the reflection: the conscience is a great\\ncasuist. There is, however, some doubt about Defoe\\'s intention:\\nis it meant to be an ironical touch about his heroine\\'s moral\\nduplicities, her tendency to be blind to the beam in her own eye?\\nor did Defoe forget Moll as he raged inwardly at the thought of\\nhow careless parents are, and how richly they deserve to be\\npunished?\\nIf Defoe intended the passage to be an ironical portrayal of\\nspiritual self-deception, it becomes necessary to assume that he\\nsaw Moll Flanders\\'s character as a whole in this light, for the\\nincident is typical of her general blindness to her own spiritual\\nand mental dishonesty. She always lies about her financial\\nposition, for instance, even to those she loves.

Later, after his departure, she\\nsays: \\'Nothing that ever befell me in my life sank so deep into\\nmy heart as this farewell. I reproached him a thousand times in\\nmy thoughts for leaving me, for I would have gone with him\\nthrough the world, if I had begged my bread. I felt in my pocket,\\nand there I found ten guineas, his gold watch, and two little\\nrings. . . .\\' 1 She cannot even in theory attest the reality of her\\ndevotion by expressing her willingness to beg her bread, without\\nimmediately proving that it was only a rhetorical hyperbole by\\n125\\nreassuring herself that she has enough in her pocket to keep her\\nin bread for a lifetime. There is surely no conscious irony here:\\nfor Defoe and his heroine generous sentiments are good, and\\nconcealed cash reserves are good too, perhaps better; but there\\nis no feeling that they conflict, or that one attitude undermines\\nthe other.\\nDefoe had accused the occasional conformists of \\'playing Bo-\\nPeep with God Almighty\\'. 2 The term admirably describes the\\npolitic equivocations about common honesty and moral truth so\\ncommon in Moll Flanders. Defoe there \\'plays Bo-Peep\\' at various\\nlevels: from the sentence and the incident to the fundamental\\nethical structure of the whole book, his moral attitude to his\\ncreation is as shallow and devious and easily deflected as his\\nheroine\\'s on the occasion when her married gallant writes to her\\nto terminate the affair, and urges her to change her ways, she\\nwrites: \\'I was struck with this letter, as with a thousand wounds;\\nthe reproaches of my own conscience were such as I cannot\\nexpress, for I was not blind to my own crime; and I reflected\\nthat I might with less offence have continued with my brother,\\nsince there was no crime in our marriage on that score, neither\\nof us knowing it.\\' 3\\nNo writer who had allowed himself to contemplate either his\\nheroine\\'s conscience, or the actual moral implications of her\\ncareer, in a spirit of irony, could have written this seriously. Nor\\ncould he have written the account of James\\'s moral reformation,\\nin which Moll Flanders tells us how she brought him the riches\\ngiven by her son, not forgetting \\'the horses, hogs, and cows, and\\nother stores for our plantation\\' and concludes \\'from this time\\nforward I believe he was as sincere a penitent and as thoroughly\\na reformed man as ever God\\'s goodness brought\\n____________________\\nI, 154, 158.\\n2 T rue Collection..., p. 315.\\n3 I , 126.\\n-125-\\nback from a profligate, a highwayman, and a robber\\'. 1 We, not\\nDefoe, are ironically aware of the juxtaposition of the powers of\\nGod and Mammon; we, not Defoe, laugh at the concept of\\nreformation through hogs and cows.\\nWhatever disagreement there may be about particular instances,\\nit is surely certain that there is no consistently ironical attitude\\n126\\npresent in Moll Flanders. Irony in its extended sense expresses a\\ndeep awareness of the contradictions and incongruities that\\nbeset man in this vale of tears, an awareness which is\\nmanifested in the text\\'s purposeful susceptibility to contradictory\\ninterpretations. As soon as we have become aware of the\\nauthor\\'s ulterior purpose, we can see all the apparent\\ncontradictions as indications of the coherent attitude underlying\\nthe whole work. Such a way of writing obviously makes severe\\ndemands upon the attention of the author and the reader: the\\nimplication of every word, the juxtaposition of every episode, the\\nrelation of every part to the whole, all must exclude any\\ninterpretation except the intended one. It is, as we have seen,\\nvery unlikely that Defoe wrote in this way, or that he had such\\nreaders; indeed, all the evidence points the other way.\\nIt may be objected that Defoe wrote at least one avowedly\\nironical work, The Shortest Way with Dissenters ( 1702). And it\\nis true that there he very successfully imitated the style, the\\ntemper and the basic strategy of the exasperated High\\nChurchmen who at last saw an opportunity under Anne for\\ncrushing the Dissenters. Actually, however, as is well known,\\nmany readers took the pamphlet as a genuine expression of\\nextreme Tory churchmanship; and the reason for this is made\\nclear by a study of the work: as in Moll Flanders, Defoe\\'s\\nvicarious identification with the supposed speaker was so\\ncomplete that it obscured his original intention; his only\\nconscious exercise in irony, in fact, was indeed a masterpiece,\\nbut a masterpiece not of irony but of impersonation.\\nThere is not time here to demonstrate this at length, but the\\ncontemporary reception of The Shortest Way at least shows that\\nit does not constitute irrefutable evidence that irony was a\\nweapon which Defoe could handle effectively. Nor, indeed, is this\\nview held by all those who see Moll Flanders as a work of irony.\\nBonamy Dobrée, for example, in a persuasive commentary\\n____________________\\n1 I I, 160.\\n-126-\\nfinds the novel \\'full of delicious irony so long as we keep outside\\nMoll. But since, as he admits and as has been argued above, it is\\nvery difficult to believe that Defoe was objective enough to be\\nable to keep outside his heroine, Dobrée\\'s claim that Moll\\nFlanders is \\'an astonishing incomparable masterpiece\\' 1 seems to\\ndepend on the view that its irony is unintentional and\\n127\\nunconscious.\\nOur crucial problem, therefore, would seem to be how we can\\nexplain the fact that a novel which was not intended ironically\\nshould be seen in such a light by so many modern readers. The\\nanswer would seem to be a matter not of literary criticism but of\\nsocial history. We cannot today believe that so intelligent a man\\nas Defoe should have viewed either his heroine\\'s economic\\nattitudes or her pious protestations with anything other than\\nderision. Defoe\\'s other writings, however, do not support this\\nbelief, and it may be surmised that the course of history has\\nbrought about in us powerful and often unconscious\\npredispositions to regard certain matters ironically which Defoe\\nand his age treated quite seriously.\\nAmong these predispositions, these ironigenic attitudes, two at\\nleast are strongly aroused by Moll Flanders: the guilt feelings\\nwhich are now fairly widely attached to economic gain as a\\nmotive; and the view that protestations of piety are suspect\\nanyway, especially when combined with a great attention to\\none\\'s own economic interest. But, as we have seen, Defoe was\\ninnocent of either attitude. He was not ashamed to make\\neconomic self-interest his major premise about human life; he\\ndid not think such a premise conflicted either with social or\\nreligious values; and nor did his age. It is likely, therefore, that\\none group of apparent ironies in Moll Flanders can be explained\\nas products of an unresolved and largely unconscious conflict in\\nDefoe\\'s own outlook, a conflict which is typical of the late Puritan\\ndisengagement of economic matters from religious and moral\\nsanctions.\\nMost of the other ironies in Moll Flanders can be explained on\\nsimilar lines. One group of apparent ironies, we noted, centred\\nround the deflation of emotional considerations by practical ones:\\nhere, surely, we have the rational and sceptical instincts of Defoe\\nunconsciously rebelling against the sentimental scenes and\\nspeeches which the genre and its readers\\n____________________\\n1 \" Some Aspects of Defoe\\'s Prose\\'\", Pope and His\\nContemporaries, Essays Presented to George Sherburn, ed.\\nClifford and Landa ( Oxford, 1949), p. 176.\\n-127-\\nrequired. Another group of possible ironies centres round the\\namorous adventures of the heroine; we find it difficult to believe\\n128\\nthat these were told only for purposes of moral edification. Yet\\nthe ambivalence here is typical of the secularised Puritan. John\\nDunton, for example, an eccentric Dissenter and an acquaintance\\nof Defoe\\'s, wrote a monthly paper exposing prostitution, The\\nNight Walker: or, Evening Rambles in Search after Lewd Women\\n( 1696-97), in which a virtuous purpose is avowed as strongly\\nand as unconvincingly as it is today by sensational journalists\\nengaged in similar appeals to public lubricity. An even closer\\nanalogy is supplied by Pepys: he bought a pornographic work\\nand read it in his office on Sundays, commenting \\'a mighty lewd\\nbook, but not amiss for a sober man to read once over to inform\\nhimself in the villainy of the world.\\' 1\\nThere are other areas of conflict in Defoe\\'s outlook which explain\\ntwo further important difficulties in the critical interpretation of\\nMoll Flanders. One reason for the feeling that Defoe cannot be\\nserious about Moll\\'s spiritual reformation is that her remorse and\\npenitence are not supported by the action or even by any sense\\nof real psychological change: as in Robinson Crusoe, the spiritual\\ndimension is presented as a series of somewhat inexplicable\\nreligious breakdowns in the psychic mechanism, breakdowns,\\nhowever, which do not permanently impair her healthy\\namorality. But this dissociation of religion from ordinary life was\\na natural consequence of secularisation, and the same feature of\\nthe life of Defoe\\'s time is probably also the cause of the central\\nconfusion in Moll Flanders\\'s moral consciousnessher tendency to\\nconfuse penitence for her sins with chagrin at the punishment of\\nher crimes. The secularisation of individual morality obviously\\ntended to emphasise the distinction which Hobbes made when he\\nwrote that \\'every crime is a sin, but not every sin a crime\\'; 2 is\\nsurely because Moll Flanders\\'s genuine fears only extend to the\\nprobable results of the discovery of her crimes that we feel, to\\nquote Reed Whittemore, that in her moral consciousness \\'Hell is\\nalmost bound by Newgate\\'s wall\\'. 3\\nMany of the apparent discrepancies in Moll Flanders, then, are\\nconcerned with areas of individual morality where the last two\\ncenturies have taught us to make careful distinctions, but where\\nthe early eighteenth century tended to be a good deal\\n____________________\\n1 D iary, ed.

It is natural, therefore, that we should be prone to\\nsee irony where there is more probably only a confusion -- a\\nconfusion which our century is much better prepared to discern\\nthan was Defoe or his age. It is probably significant in this\\nconnection that the most ardent admirers of Moll Flanders are\\nunhistorical in their outlook and interests. E. M. Forster, for\\ninstance, in Aspects of the Novel specifically excludes period\\nconsiderations from his inquiry; while John Peale Bishop, perhaps\\naccepting but misreading Defoe\\'s concluding assertion \\'Written in\\nthe year 1683\\', dates the novel itself in 1668. 1\\nThere is another historical explanation of a somewhat different\\nkind for the modern tendency to read Moll Flanders ironically:\\nthe rise of the novel. We place Defoe\\'s novels in a very different\\ncontext from that of their own time; we take novels much more\\nseriously now, and we judge his by the more exacting literary\\nstandards of today. This presumption, combined with Defoe\\'s\\nactual mode of writing, forces us to explain a great deal as\\nironical. We believe, for example, that a sentence should have\\nunity; if we must invent one for sentences which are really a\\nrandom accumulation of clauses containing many disparate or\\nincongruous items, we can impose unity only by an ironical\\nsubordination of some items to others. Similarly with the larger\\nunits of composition, from the paragraph to the total structure: if\\nwe assume on a priori grounds that a coherent plan must be\\npresent, we find one, and thereby produce a complex pattern out\\nof what are actually incongruities.\\nLife itself, of course, is a suitable enough object for ironical\\ncontemplation, and so the tendency to regard Moll Flanders as\\nironic is in a sense a tribute to Defoe\\'s vitality as a writer -- it is\\npartly because what he creates seems so real that we feel we\\nmust define our attitude to it. But, of course, such an attitude on\\nthe reader\\'s part is excluded by genuinely ironical writing more\\nthan by any other: every way of looking at the events has been\\nanticipated and either organised into the whole work, or made\\nimpossible. There is no evidence of such an exclusion in Moll\\nFlanders, much less of a comprehensive control operating over\\nevery aspect of the work. If they are ironies, they are surely the\\nironies of social and moral and literary disorder. Perhaps,\\nhowever, they are better regarded not as the achievements of an\\nironist, but as accidents produced by the random application\\n____________________\\n1 C ollected Essays, p. 47; the actual date was 1722.\\n-129-\\n131\\nof narrative authenticity to conflicts in Defoe\\'s social and moral\\nand religious world, accidents which unwittingly reveal to us the\\nserious discrepancies in his system of values.\\nThat these discrepancies are revealed at all, incidentally, is a\\ntribute to the searching power of formal realism, which permits\\nand indeed encourages the presentation of literary objects and\\nattitudes which had not hitherto jostled each other in the same\\nwork but had been segregated in separate ones such as tragedy,\\ncomedy, history, picaresque, journalism and homily. Later\\nnovelists such as Jane Austen and Flaubert were to incorporate\\nsuch conflicts and incongruities into the very structure of their\\nworks: they created irony, and made novel readers sensitive to\\nits effects. We cannot but approach Defoe\\'s novels through the\\nliterary expectations which later masters of the form made\\npossible, and these expectations seem to find some justification\\nas a result of our acute awareness of the conflicting nature of the\\ntwo main forces in Defoe\\'s philosophy of life -- rational economic\\nindividualism and concern for spiritual redemption -- which\\ntogether held his divided but not, apparently, uneasy allegiance.\\nNevertheless, if we are primarily concerned with Defoe\\'s actual\\nintentions, we must conclude that although he reveals the\\nsophistries whereby these dual allegiances are preserved intact,\\nhe does not, strictly speaking, portray them; consequently Moll\\nFlanders is undoubtedly an ironic object, but it is not a work of\\nirony.\\nIV\\nThe preceding sections are not intended as a denial of the\\nimportance of Defoe as a novelist, but only as a demonstration of\\na fact that might perhaps have been taken for granted if it had\\nnot been challenged or overlooked by many recent critics: the\\nfact that Defoe\\'s novels lack both the consistency in matters of\\ndetail of which many lesser writers are capable, and the larger\\ncoherences found in the greatest literature. Defoe\\'s forte was the\\nbrilliant episode. Once his imagination seized on a situation he\\ncould report it with a comprehensive fidelity which was much in\\nadvance of any previous fiction, and which, indeed, has never\\nbeen surpassed. These episodes are irresistible in quotation; and\\nthe pre-eminence of Moll Flanders is perhaps mainly due to its\\nstrong claim to be not so much a great novel as Defoe\\'s richest\\nanthology.\\n-130-\\nHow far we should allow Defoe\\'s gift for the perfect episode to\\n131\\noutweigh his patent shortcomings -- weaknesses of construction,\\ninattention to detail, lack of moral or formal pattern -- is a very\\ndifficult critical problem. There is something about Defoe\\'s genius\\nwhich is as confident and indestructible as the resilient selfhood\\nof his heroine, and which all but persuades us to accept the\\nnotorious critical heresy that the single talent well employed can\\nmake up for all the others.\\nThe talent, of course, is the supreme one in the novel: Defoe is\\nthe master illusionist, and this almost makes him the founder of\\nthe new form. Almost, but not quite: the novel could be\\nconsidered established only when realistic narrative was\\norganised into a plot which, while retaining Defoe\\'s lifelikeness,\\nalso had an intrinsic coherence; when the novelist\\'s eye was\\nfocussed on character and personal relationships as essential\\nelements in the total structure, and not merely as subordinate\\ninstruments for furthering the verisimilitude of the actions\\ndescribed; and when all these were related to a controlling moral\\nintention. It was Richardson who took these further steps, and it\\nis primarily for this reason that he, rather than Defoe, is usually\\nregarded as the founder of the English novel.\\nDefoe created his own personal genre, which stands wholly alone\\nin the history of literature, as befits the creator of Robinson\\nCrusoe: and this solitary position is directly related to the role of\\nindividualism in his works, as is suggested by the curiously close\\nparallel between his fiction and the plays of an earlier\\nindividualist and literary innovator, Christopher Marlowe.\\nBoth men were lowly born, poor, well educated, restless,\\nenergetic; both found it difficult to find a satisfactory place in the\\nsociety of their day, and both eventually achieved contact with\\nthe mysteries of power through the seamier side of government,\\nas informers and secret agents. Their lives are reflected in their\\nwritings. Both expressed themselves most fully through\\ncharacters who are radically alienated from society, and who\\nappear to be unconscious autobiographical projections; certainly,\\ndespite their vastly different circumstances they have a strong\\nfamily resemblance -- Tamburlaine to Barabas and Faustus,\\nRobinson Crusoe to Moll Flanders and Colonel Jacque. The\\npresence of such central characters is associated both in Marlowe\\nand Defoe with similar structural and thematic difficulties. The\\nplots tend to be episodic, and the basic\\n-131-\\nconflict is not fully embodied in terms of relationships between\\n132\\nthe characters -- all tends to resolve itself into an ego contra\\nmundum. The issue of the conflict is similarly ambiguous: the\\nmoral, social and religious norms which are eventually brought in\\nto punish the hero for his defiant self-assertion are less\\nconvincingly presented than his breaches of them, so that their\\ntriumph seems at best perfunctory, and leaves us in some doubt\\nas to how fully it is endorsed by the author.\\nThe most positive value that emerges from the works of Defoe\\nand Marlowe is certainly not that of the traditional moral order;\\nas in the case of Stendhal, the supreme expression of\\nindividualism in French literature, the vision of life presented is\\nremarkable not for its wisdom but for its energy. This duality,\\nperhaps, poses the central problem both for the moral evaluation\\nof individualism in general, and of the figure of Moll Flanders. Her\\nwisdom is not impressive; it is at best of a low atavistic kind\\nwholly directed to the problems of survival; but nothing could be\\nmore impressive than her energy, and it too has a moral\\npremise, a kind of inarticulate and yet fortifying stoicism.\\nEverything happens to Moll Flanders and nothing leaves scars;\\nthe very tone of her reminiscences assures us that no vicissitude\\ncan ever impair her comfortable vitality; our grossest crimes and\\nour most contemptible moral weaknesses, apparently, will never\\ndeprive us of the love of others or even of our own self-respect;\\nthe whole book, indeed, is a series of variations on\\nindividualism\\'s eternal challenge to the orthodoxy of the present\\nand the wisdom of the past, a sequence in which the heroine, an\\nunabashed Parolles, asserts defiantly, \\'Simply the thing I am\\nshall make me live\\'.\\nThese words epitomise the claim which both the form and the\\ncontent of Defoe\\'s novels make on posterity; and it is very\\nappropriate that the claim should have been fully allowed only\\nwhen, after the passing of nearly two centuries which had\\naccorded them only a somewhat sub-literary farne, 1 they found\\na new resonance in the last few decades, decades when the\\nnovel, and its associated way of life, individualism, seem to have\\ncome full circle.\\nAt a time when the technique of the novel had reached an\\nunexampled complication, Defoe\\'s formal artlessness seemed\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Charles E. Burch, \"British Criticism of Defoe as a Novelist,\\n1719-1860\", Englische Studien, LXVIII ( 1932), 178-198.\\n-132-\\n133\\nmore piquant than ever before. It was easy to see the\\ncumbrousness of Richardson or the artificiality of Fielding,\\nbecause the novel had gone far beyond their solutions of its\\nformal problems. But Defoe did not compete, and it was\\nrefreshing to acclaim a writer who still spoke vividly to us\\nalthough he had not, apparently, given a moment\\'s reflection as\\nto the technical problems involved in so doing: and, in the novel\\nform at least, artless authenticity seemed preferable to all but\\nthe highest art. So Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forster gave us a\\nDefoe of the \\'twenties, an ally in the onslaught on the\\nmechanical craftsmanship of Arnold Bennett and Galsworthy.\\nAt the same time, and in the succeeding decades, the intellectual\\nand social bases of individualism were being challenged as never\\nbefore, and this also bestowed an ironical topicality on the work\\nof an early recorder of its triumphs and degradations. The\\nSecond World War, especially, brought us closer to the prophetic\\nnature of Defoe\\'s picture of individualism. Camus used Defoe\\'s\\nallegorical claim for Robinson Crusoe as epigraph to his own\\nallegory, La Peste ( 1948): \\'It is as reasonable to represent one\\nkind of imprisonment by another, as it is to represent anything\\nthat really exists by that which exists not\\'. At the same time\\nAndré Malraux wrote that only three books, Robinson Crusoe,\\nDon Quixote and The Idiot, retained their truth for those who\\nhad seen prisons and concentration camps. 1\\nDefoe\\'s concentration on isolated individuals, it would seem, is\\ncloser to the view of life held by many writers today than to\\nthose held in the intervening centuries. It is likely that these\\nwriters read more into Defoe than he seriously intended, and\\nthat the modern alienation is much more complex and less\\nvoluntary than that of Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders. But\\nwhatever Defoe\\'s consciousness of the symbolic quality of his\\nnovels may have been, it is certain that, at the end of the long\\ntradition of the European novel, and of the society whose\\nindividualism, leisure and unexampled security allowed it to\\nmake personal relations the major theme of its literature, Defoe\\nis a welcome and portentous figure. Welcome because he seems\\nlong ago to have called the great bluff of the novel -- its\\nsuggestion that personal relations really are the be-all and endall\\nof life; portentous because he, and only he, among the great\\nwriters of the past, has presented the struggle for survival in the\\n____________________\\n1 L es Noyes de I\\'Allenburg ( Paris, 1948), pp. 119-121.\\n-133-\\n134\\nbleak perspectives which recent history has brought back to a\\ncommanding position on the human stage.\\nThe accidents of history, then, treated Defoe fortunately,\\nalthough he courted them as no other writer has done, and\\ndeserves his reward. They impelled him to a step which was\\ndecisive in the history of the novel. His blind and almost\\npurposeless concentration on the actions of his heroes and\\nheroines, and his unconscious and unreflective mingling of their\\nthoughts and his about the inglorious world in which they both\\nexist, made possible the expression of many motives and themes\\nwhich could not, perhaps, have come into the tradition of the\\nnovel without Defoe\\'s shock tactics: motives such as economic\\negoism and social alienation; and themes such as the conflicts\\nbetween old and new sets of values as they are manifested in\\ndaily life. Very few writers have created for themselves both a\\nnew subject and a new literary form to embody it. Defoe did\\nboth. In his somewhat monocular concentration on making his\\nmatter seem absolutely convincing, there was much he did not\\nsee. But what is left out is probably the price for what is so\\nmemorably and unprecedentedly put in.\\n-134-\\nCHAPTER V\\nLove and the Novel: \\'Pamela\\'\\nTHE importance of Richardson\\'s position in the tradition of the\\nnovel was largely due to his success in dealing with several of\\nthe major formal problems which Defoe had left unsolved. The\\nmost important of them was probably that of plot, and here\\nRichardson\\'s solution was remarkably simple: he avoided an\\nepisodic plot by basing his novels on a single action, a courtship.\\nIt is no doubt odd that so fateful a literary revolution should have\\nbeen brought about with so ancient a literary weapon; but -- and\\nthis is the theme of the present chapter -- in Richardson\\'s hands\\nit revealed new powers.\\nI\\nMadame de Staël linked the fact that the Ancients had no novels\\nwith the fact that, largely as a result of the inferior social position\\nof women, the classical world attached relatively little importance\\nto the emotional relationships between men and women. 1 It is\\ncertainly true that classical Greece and Rome knew little of\\nromantic love in our sense, and the erotic life in general was not\\ngiven anything like the importance and approbation it has\\n135\\nreceived in modern life and literature. Even in Euripides sexual\\npassion is clearly considered as a violation of the human norm;\\nwhile not exactly a vice, it is certainly not a virtue; and, for the\\nman especially, to allow it much scope is an indication of\\nweakness rather than strength. As for Latin literature, its\\nsimilarly derogatory attitude is suggested by a passage in the\\ncommentary of Servius on the Aeneid: he explains that Dido\\'s\\nlove was not a serious enough subject for epic dignity, but that\\nVirgil had redeemed himself by treating it in an almost comic\\nstyle -- paene comicus stilus est: nec mirum, ubi de amore\\ntractatur. 2\\nThe idea that love between the sexes is to be regarded as the\\nsupreme value of life on earth is generally agreed to have had its\\n____________________\\n1 D e la littérature, considirée dans ses rapports avec lei\\ninstitutions sociales, in OEuvres complètes ( Paris, 1820), IV,\\n215-217.\\nBk. IV, n. 1.\\n-135-\\norigin in the rise of amour courtois in eleventh-century Provence.\\nCourtly love is in essence the result of the transfer of an attitude\\nof religious adoration from a divine to a secular object -- from\\nthe Virgin Mary to the lady worshipped by the troubadour. Like\\nmodern individualism, therefore, the rise of romantic love has\\ndeep roots in the Christian tradition, and so it is very appropriate\\nthat it should be the basis of the ideal pattern of sexual\\nbehaviour in our society. The most universal religion of the West,\\naccording to Vilfredo Pareto, 1 at least, is the sex religion; the\\nnovel supplies it with its doctrine and its rituals, just as the\\nmediaeval romances had done for courtly love.\\nCourtly love, however, could not itself provide the kind of\\nconnective or structural theme which the novel required. It was\\nprimarily a leisure fantasy invented to gratify the noble lady\\nwhose actual social and economic future had already been\\ndecided by her marriage to a feudal lord; it belonged to an amoral\\nworld, a social vacuum where only the individual existed\\nand where the external world, with its drastic legal and religious\\nsanctions against adultery, 2 was completely forgotten.\\nConsequently the forms of mediaeval literature which dealt with\\neveryday life paid no attention to courtly love, and presented\\nwomankind as a species characterised by an insatiate fleshly\\ncupidity; while, on the other hand, the verse and prose romances\\n136\\nwhich dealt with courtly love presented their heroines as angelic\\nbeings, and this idealisation was usually extended to the\\npsychology, the background and the language of the story. Not\\nonly so: from the point of view of plot, heroic chastity is subject\\nto exactly the same literary defects as inveterate promiscuity;\\nboth are poor in the qualities of development and surprise. In the\\nromances, therefore, while courtly love provided the\\nconventional beginning and end, the main interest of the\\nnarrative lay in the adventures which the knight achieved for his\\nlady, and not in the development of the love relationship itself.\\nGradually, however, the code of romantic love began to\\naccommodate itself to religious, social and psychological reality,\\nnotably to marriage and the family. This process seems to have\\noccurred particularly early in England, and the new ideology\\n____________________\\n1 T he Mind and Society, trans.

Denis de Rougemont,\\nin his study of the development of romantic love, writes of the\\nFrench novel that \\'to judge by its literature, adultery would seem\\nto be one of the most characteristic occupations of Western\\nman\\'. 1 Not so in England, where the break with the originally\\nadulterous character of courtly love was so complete that George\\nMoore was almost justified in claiming to have \\'invented\\nadultery, which didn\\'t exist in the English novel till I began\\nwriting\\'. 2\\nThere are signs of the reconciliation between courtly love and the\\ninstitution of marriage at least as early as Chaucer Franklin\\'s\\nTale, and it is very evident in Spenser Faerie Queene. Later the\\nPuritanism that is already strong in Spenser finds its supreme\\nexpression in Paradise Lost which is, among other things, the\\ngreatest and indeed the only epic of married life. In the next two\\ncenturies the Puritan conception of marriage and sexual relations\\ngenerally became the accepted code of Anglo-Saxon society to a\\ndegree unknown elsewhere; in the words of Frieda Lawrence,\\nwho must be allowed considerable expertise in the matter, \\'only\\nthe English have this special brand of marriage . . . the God137\\ngiven unity of marriage... that is part of Puritanism\\'. 3\\nRichardson played an important part in establishing this new\\ncode. He wrote at a time when a variety of economic and social\\nchanges, some of them temporary and local, but most of them\\ncharacteristic of modern English and American civilisation, were\\ncombining to make marriage much more important for women\\nthan before, and at the same time much more difficult to\\nachieve. These changes gave Richardson the enormous\\nadvantage over the writers of romance that, without recourse to\\nany extraneous elements of complication, he could reflect the\\nactual life of his time and yet be able to expand a single intrigue\\ninto the proportions of a novel considerably longer than any by\\nDefoe. In Pamela the relationship of the lovers has all the\\nabsolute quality of romantic love; and yet it can realistically be\\nmade to involve many of the basic problems\\n____________________\\n1 L \\' Amour el l\\'Occident ( Paris, 1939), p. 2.\\n2 C it.

The relationship between Pamela\\nand Mr. B., in fact, can carry the whole weight of the literary\\nstructure in a way that was impossible in the romances.\\nII\\nThe values of courtly love could not be combined with those of\\nmarriage until marriage was primarily the result of a free choice\\nby the individuals concerned. This freedom of choice has until\\nrecently been the exception rather than the rule in the history of\\nhuman society, especially as far as women have been concerned.\\nThe rise of the novel, then, would seem to be connected with the\\nmuch greater freedom of women in modern society, a freedom\\nwhich, especially as regards marriage, was achieved earlier and\\nmore completely in England than elsewhere.\\nIn eighteenth-century France, for example, daughters were\\ncustomarily secluded from young men until their parents had\\narranged a marriage for them. The extent of women\\'s freedom in\\nEngland was very striking in comparison, as Montesquieu 1 and\\n138\\nmany other contemporaries pointed out. In Germany the position\\nof women was considered to be even more disadvantageous, 2\\nwhile Lady Mary Wortley Montagu criticised Sir Charles Grandison\\non the grounds that Richardson should have known enough\\nabout the restrictions on feminine rights in Italy to realise that\\nhis hero could never have begun his amour with Clementina in\\nher father\\'s house. 3\\nThe relatively great freedom of women in England had existed at\\nleast as far back as the Elizabethan period, but it was reinforced\\nin the eighteenth century by some aspects of the rise of\\nindividualism. Economic individualism, we have seen, tended to\\nweaken the ties between parents and children: and its spread\\nwas associated with the development of a new kind of family\\nsystem which has since become the standard one in most\\nmodern societies.\\n____________________\\n1 L \\'Esprit des lois, Bk.

R. Radcliffe-Brown\\'s term, 1 or as the \\'conjugal\\' family, to use\\némile Durkheim\\'s. 2 In nearly all countries, of course, the family\\nunit includes the \\'elementary\\' or \\'conjugal\\' group consisting of\\nhusband, wife and their children, but it also includes a whole\\ncomplex of other less closely related kinsfolk: the use of the\\nterms here, therefore, has a real defining force because it\\nindicates that this elementary or conjugal group alone is what\\nconstitutes the family in our society; it is an entity formed by the\\nvoluntary union of two individuals.\\nThis kind of family, for which we will here use Durkheim\\'s term\\n\\'conjugal\\' as somewhat more descriptive and perhaps less\\ninvidious than Radcliffe-Brown\\'s term \\'elementary\\', is different\\nfrom those of other societies and other periods in many respects,\\namong which may be mentioned the following: on marriage the\\ncouple immediately sets up as a new family, wholly separate\\nfrom their own parents and often far away from them; there is\\nno established priority between the male and female lines of\\ndescent as regards property or authority, but instead both\\n139\\nlineages are of equal relative unimportance; extended kinship\\nties in general, to grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, etc.,\\nhave no compelling significance; and once set up, the conjugal\\nfamily typically becomes an autonomous unit in economic as well\\nas in social affairs.\\nThese arrangements seem obvious enough to us today, but they\\nare in fact historically new, and they all increase the importance\\nof the marriage choice. This choice is especially fateful for the\\nwoman, because, as a result of masculine dominance in the\\neconomic field, and of the social, residential and occupational\\nmobility brought about by capitalism, it determines, not only her\\nmost important personal relationship, but also her social,\\neconomic and even geographical future. It is natural, therefore,\\nthat modern sociologists should see romantic love as a necessary\\ncorrelative of the conjugal family system; 3 a strengthening of\\nthe intrinsic bonds between man and wife being absolutely\\nnecessary to replace the greater security and continuity of the\\nwoman\\'s lot afforded by more cohesive and\\n____________________\\n1 \" Introduction\", African Systems of Kinship and Marriage, ed.\\nRadcliffe- Brown and Forde ( London, 1950), pp. 4-5, 43-46,\\n60-63.\\n2 \" La Famille conjugale\", Revue philosophique, XCI ( 1921), 1-\\n14.\\n3 S ee Talcott Parsons, \"The Kinship System of the United\\nStates\", Essays in Sociological Theory Pure and Applied\\n(Glencoe, 1949), p. 241.\\n-139-\\nextended family systems, and to provide the isolated conjugal\\nunit, and especially the wife, with a strong supporting ideology.\\nHow thoroughly and how extensively the conjugal family system\\nwas established in early eighteenth-century England is difficult to\\nsay -- systematised information on the subject is very hard to\\ncome by. It certainly seems likely that in the seventeenth\\ncentury the traditional and patriarchal family pattern was by far\\nthe commonest. The term family, in Gregory King as in\\nShakespeare, refers to a whole household and often includes\\ngrandparents, cousins and even remoter kin, as well as servants\\nand other employees, as the modern term has it. The family in\\nthis larger sense was the primary legal, religious and economic\\nunit, under control of the paterfamilias. In economic affairs, for\\nexample, much of the food and clothing was manufactured in the\\n141\\nhome, and even the goods produced for the market were mainly\\nproduced by domestic industry; consequently it was the income\\nof the family group as a whole which mattered, and not personal\\ncash wages.\\nEconomically, then, the patriarchal family stood in the way of\\nindividualism, and it is probably for this reason that the conjugal\\nfamily system has established itself most strongly in individualist\\nand Protestant societies, and that it is essentially urban and\\nmiddle class in nature.\\nOne of the earliest indications of the transition from the\\npatriarchal family and domestic industry is the Jacobean outcry\\nagainst the decay of \\'housekeeping\\', 1 a decay which\\ncontemporaries attributed to the rise in power and numbers of\\nthe trading and commercial classes. It is fairly generally agreed\\nthat this section of the community first showed its strength in\\nthe Civil War, and it is significant, therefore, that Sir Robert\\nFilmer, the chief theorist on the Royalist side, should have\\nshowed in his Patriarcha, published posthumously in 1680, that\\nfor him at least the new political and social movement challenged\\nnothing less than the time-honoured basis of society and\\nreligion, the authority of the father over his family which was the\\nemblem of every other kind of authority and order. 2 It is equally\\nsignificant that\\n____________________\\n1 S ee L.

Once they could do so, he believed, \\'the bonds of\\nsubjection\\' should \\'drop quite off, and leave a man at his own\\nfree disposal\\'. 1 Locke is thus in one important respect a\\ntheoretician of the conjugal family.\\nOn the whole, however, the picture of the family in the early\\neighteenth century is still one of slow and confused transition.\\n141\\nSuch, certainly, is the suggestion of the works of Defoe and\\nRichardson, who, as middle-class Londoners, belonged to the\\nsocial milieu where the transition was likely to be most\\nadvanced. They themselves are strongly on the traditional side\\nas regards the authority of the father and the vital importance of\\nthe family group as a moral and religious entity; on the other\\nhand, the tendency of their novels seems to be towards the\\nassertion of individual freedom from family ties.\\nThis assertion, however, was very difficult for the heroines of\\nDefoe and Richardson to achieve, for a variety of reasons.\\nTo begin with, the legal position of women in the eighteenth\\ncentury was very largely governed by the patriarchal concepts of\\nRoman law. The only person in the household who was sui juris,\\nwho was a legal entity, was its head, usually the father. A\\nwoman\\'s property, for instance, became her husband\\'s\\nabsolutely on marriage, although it was customary to arrange a\\njointure for her when the marriage articles were drawn up; the\\nchildren were in law the husband\\'s; only the husband could sue\\nfor divorce; and he had the right to punish his wife by beating or\\nimprisoning her.\\nIt is true that this legal position was not thought by\\ncontemporaries to represent the realities of the situation. The\\n1729 edition of Magnae Britanniae Notitia, conceding that\\nmarried women \\'with all their movable goods... are wholly in\\npotestate viri\\', continued that \\'notwithstanding all which, their\\ncondition de facto is the best of the world\\'. 2 The legal position,\\nhowever, certainly emphasised the need for women to make the\\n____________________\\n1 T wo Treatises of Government, ( 1690), \"Essay concerning Civil\\nGovernment,\" sect. 55.\\n2 P . 174.\\n-141-\\nright marriage and thus ensure that \\'their condition de facto\\'\\nshould not be merely the expression of their abject legal status.\\nThe opposition between patriarchal and individualist attitudes is\\nshown very clearly by the fact that the patriarchal legal situation\\nof married women made it impossible for them to realise the\\naims of economic individualism. As we should expect, Defoe saw\\nthis side of the question very clearly, and dramatised the gravity\\nof the problem in the morally desperate expedient which Roxana\\n142\\nis forced to adopt to overcome the legal disabilities of women. As\\na \\'she-merchant\\' she realises that the pursuit of money cannot\\nbe combined with marriage, since \\'the very nature of the\\nmarriage contract was... nothing but giving up liberty, estate,\\nauthority, and everything to the man, and the woman was\\nindeed a mere woman ever after -- that is to say, a slave\\'. So\\nshe refuses marriage, even with a nobleman, because \\'I was as\\nwell without the titles as long as I had the estate, and while I\\nhad £2,000 a year of my own I was happier than I could be in\\nbeing prisoner of state to a nobleman, for I took the ladies of\\nthat rank to be little better\\'. 1 Indeed Defoe\\'s economic\\nenthusiasm takes him perilously close to proving that, given a\\nknowledge of banking and investment, Roxana\\'s scandalous\\nspecialty could be developed into the most lucrative career then\\nopen to women.\\nTo those without Roxana\\'s peculiar combination of qualities,\\nhowever, the achievement of economic independence outside\\nmarriage was becoming increasingly difficult in the eighteenth\\ncentury. The decay of domestic industry affected women very\\nadversely. A large surplus of women was created in the labour\\nmarket, and this had the result of bringing down their wages to\\nan average of something like 2S. 6d. a week, about a quarter of\\nthe average wage for men. 2\\nAt the same time women found it much more difficult to find a\\nhusband unless they could bring him a dowry. There is much\\nevidence to suggest that marriage became a much more\\ncommercial matter in the eighteenth century than had previously\\nbeen the case. Newspapers carried on marriage marts, with\\nadvertisements offering or demanding specified dowries and\\njointures; and young girls were driven into flagrantly unsuitable\\n____________________\\n1 R oxana, ed.

According to\\nSir William Temple, writing at the end of the seventeenth\\ncentury, the custom of making marriages \\'just like other\\ncommon bargains and sales, by the mere consideration of\\n143\\ninterest or gain, without any of love or esteem\\' was \\'of no\\nancient date\\'. 1 Economic factors, of course, had in fact always\\nbeen important in arranging marriages; but it is likely that the\\ntraditional power of the paterfamilias was exercised with less\\nattention to nonmaterial considerations as the old family system\\nbecame subject to the pressures of economic individualism.\\nAt lower social levels there is also ample evidence to support the\\nview of Moll Flanders that the marriage market had become\\n\\'unfavourable to our sex\\'. 2 The hardships of poorer women were\\nmost dramatically expressed by the sale of wives, at prices\\nranging, apparently, from sixpence to three and a half guineas. 3\\nThey are suggested in another way by the increase in illicit\\nrelations as more males adopted the philosophy of Bunyan\\'s Mr.\\nBadman -- \\'Who would keep a cow of their own that can have a\\nquart of milk for a penny?\\'; 4 the extent of this increase is shown\\nby the fact that provision for illegitimate children became one of\\nthe main problems for those concerned with poorrelief. 5 Women\\nwere also adversely affected by an increasing masculine\\ntendency towards marrying late on economic grounds. Defoe, for\\nexample, in the Complete English Tradesman ( 1726) urged the\\nmaxim \\'Do not wed till you have sped\\'; 6 and the considerable\\neffects of this attitude are suggested by the fact that the Society\\nfor the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was led to oppose the\\ntrend because it fostered sexual immorality. 7\\nThe outlook for servant girls was particularly bad. There were, it\\nis true, some glorious catches, although none of them provide an\\nexact parallel to the supreme one made by Pamela.

For our\\npurposes, however, it is probably sufficient to know that the\\nmatter excited great and increasing public concern: whether\\nstatisticians would have confirmed them or not, many people\\ncertainly believed that the situation was grave, and called for\\ndrastic measures.\\nThe development which most clearly reveals how widely the\\ncrisis affected public attitudes is the change in the status of\\nunmarried women. The idea that the \\'old maid\\' was a ridiculous if\\nnot obnoxious type seems to have arisen in the late seventeenth\\ncentury. In 1673 Richard Allestree stated in The Ladies\\' Calling\\nthat \\'an old maid is now thought such a curse as no poetic Fury\\ncan exceed... [and as] the most calamitous creature in Nature\\'. 3\\nLater, Defoe talked a good deal about the \\'set of despicable\\ncreatures, called Old Maids\\', 4 and there are innummerable\\nliterary caricatures of the type in eighteenth-century literature,\\nfrom Mistress Tipkin in Steele The Tender Husband ( 1705) to\\nFielding\\'s Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones and Smollett\\'s Tabitha\\nBramble in Humphrey Clinker. \\'Tabby\\', incidentally, was\\napparently a dyslogistic type-name for an old maid before it was\\napplied to a humble species of cat. 5\\n____________________\\n1 S ee David Hume, \"On the Populousness of Ancient Nations\",\\nEssays and Treatises ( Edinburgh, 1817), I, 381.\\n2 J ohn H.

The first usage of the term\\nrecorded by the Oxford English Dictionary with the sense of \\'an\\nunmarried woman beyond the usual age for marriage\\' is dated\\n1719, and occurs in the first number of a newspaper called The\\nSpinster. There Steele, under the name of Rachel Woolpack,\\nrecalls that the word was not originally opprobrious, but referred\\nto the laudable \\'industry of female manufacturers\\'. In the\\neighteenth century, however, unmarried women were no longer\\npositive economic assets to the household because there was\\nless need for their labour in spinning, weaving and other\\neconomic tasks; as a result many unmarried women were faced\\nwith the unpleasant choice between working for very low wages,\\nor becoming largely superfluous dependents on someone else.\\nThe second alternative was the only one as far as those of gentle\\nbirth were concerned; for, as Jane Collier, dependent of Fielding\\nand friend of Richardson, wrote: \\'There are many methods for\\nyoung men... to acquire a genteel maintenance; but for a girl I\\nknow not one way of support that does not by the esteem of the\\nworld, throw her below the rank of gentlewornan\\'. 1 A few\\nunmarried women, it is true, such as Mistress Elizabeth Carter,\\nto whom William Hayley dedicated his Philosophical, Historical\\nand Moral Essay on Old Maids ( 1785), or Jane Austen a\\ngeneration later, were able to pursue successful literary careers;\\nand many other spinsters followed less conspicuously in their\\ntrain and provided novels for the circulating libraries. But there is\\nno recorded case in the century of a woman who supported\\nherself entirely by her pen, and in any case the career of\\nauthorship could be open only to a very small minority.\\nWhat was most needed, it was generally thought, was a\\nsubstitute for the convents which had offered a haven and a\\nvocation for gentlewomen until they were closed at the\\nReformation, and which still performed the service in Catholic\\ncountries. Mary Astell, in A Serious Proposal to the Ladies (\\n1694), had urged the establishment of a \\'monastery or religious\\nretirement\\'; Defoe had put forward a similar idea in his Essay\\nupon Projects ( 1697); while in 1739 the Gentleman\\'s Magazine\\nwas very explicit in proposing a \\'New Method of making women\\nas useful and as capable of maintaining themselves as men are,\\nand consequently preventing their becoming old maids or taking\\n146\\nill\\n____________________\\n1 E ssay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting, 1753, p. 38.\\n-145-\\ncourses\\'. 1 Richardson had the idea much at heart; Clarissa\\nlaments the fact that she cannot take shelter in a nunnery, 2\\nwhile Sir Charles Grandison strongly advocates \\'Protestant\\nNunneries\\' where \\'numbers of young women, joining their small\\nfortunes, might... maintain themselves genteelly on their own\\nincome; though each singly in the world would be distressed\\'. 3\\nHis proposal, incidentally, was the only part of the book which\\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu found to praise. 4\\nNone of these plans were carried out, however, and the tragic\\ndependence of unmarried gentlewomen continued. It is\\nnoticeable that many of the literary figures of the period were\\nsurrounded by a voluble cluster of spinsters -- Swift, Pope,\\nRichardson, Fielding, Johnson, Horace Walpole, for example.\\nMany of these were total or partial dependents; not, as they\\nmight have been earlier, economically useful members of a large\\nfamily household by right of birth, but recipients of voluntary\\nindividual charity.\\nBachelors did not excite so much commiseration as did spinsters,\\nbut the increase of their number was widely regarded as socially\\ndeplorable and morally dangerous. At the end of the seventeenth\\ncentury such political economists as Petty, Davenant and Grew\\nhad suggested that bachelors should be taxed more heavily than\\nmarried men; Petty, for example, argued that whoever refused\\nto procreate ought to \\'repair unto the state the misse of another\\npair of hands\\'. 5 There were also strong moral objections to\\nbachelorhood, especially among the Puritans: in New England\\ncelibates were not allowed to live alone. 6 Richardson manifests\\nthe same distrust in his novels, although his chief concern,\\nhowever, was not so much for the morals of the bachelors as for\\nthe interests of their potential spouses, as we can see from\\nHarriet Byron\\'s lament that \\'there are more bachelors now in\\nEngland, by many thousands, than there were a few years ago:\\nand, probably, the numbers of them (and of single women, of\\ncourse) will every year increase\\'. 7\\nMiss Byron\\'s alarm was probably well grounded.

Briefly, polygamy, whose legitimacy had been argued by\\nsome extreme Protestant bibliolators in the seventeenth century,\\nattracted both the Deists, 5 who could attack the orthodox\\nChristian view of marriage by pointing out that polygamy was\\napproved by the Mosaic Law, and the political economists, from\\nIsaac Vossius to David Hume, 6 who saw in polygamy a possible\\nsolution of the problem of depopulation, which they assumed\\n(quite wrongly) to be menacing society as a result of increasing\\ncelibacy. 7\\n148\\n____________________\\n1 G randison, II, 330.\\n2 J .

Richardson\\'s friend, Dr.\\nPatrick Delany, for example, wrote a treatise, Reflections upon\\nPolygamy, whose somewhat hysterical tone suggests a deep\\nalarm. He feared that although \\'Polygamy is indeed at present\\nabolished... how long it may continue so, under the present\\nincrease of infidelity and licentiousness, is not easy to\\npronounce\\'. 1 His book, which Richardson printed in 1737,\\nprobably supplied the material for the discussion of polygamy in\\nthe second part of Pamela, where Mr. B. appropriately makes use\\nof the arguments of the licentious Deists, although his bride\\neventually makes him renounce \\'that foolish topic\\'. 2 Lovelace,\\nhowever, continues in Mr. B.\\'s evil ways and proposes an\\ningenious and characteristic variant -- an Act of Parliament for\\nannual marriages: such a practice, he argues, would stop\\npolygamy being \\'panted after\\'; it would end the prevalence of\\n\\'the spleen or vapours\\'; and it would ensure that there would no\\nlonger remain a single \\'old maid in Great Britain and all its\\nterritories\\'. 3\\nThere is, then, a considerable variety of evidence to support the\\nview that the transition to an individualist social and economic\\norder brought with it a crisis in marriage which bore particularly\\nhard upon the feminine part of the population. Their future\\ndepended much more completely than before on their being able\\nto marry and on the kind of marriage they made, while at the\\nsame time it was more and more difficult for them to find a\\nhusband.\\nThe acuteness of this problem surely goes far to explain the\\n149\\nenormous contemporary success of Pamela. Servant girls, as we\\nhave seen, constituted a fairly important part of the reading\\npublic, and they found it particularly difficult to marry: no\\nwonder, then, that Lady Mary Wortley Montagu thought that\\nPamela\\'s matrimonial triumph had made her \\'the joy of the\\nchambermaids of all nations\\'. 4 More generally, it is likely that\\nRichardson\\'s heroine symbolised the aspirations of all the women\\nin the reading public who were subject to the difficulties\\nrecounted above. Not only so. Somewhat similar difficulties have\\nsince become standard in modern society as a result of the\\ncombined effects of economic individualism and the conjugal\\nfamily; and this would seem to explain why the great majority\\n____________________\\n1 2 nd ed., 1739, P. viii.\\n2 E veryman Edition, II, 296-339.\\n3 C larissa, III, 180-184.\\n4 L etters and Works, II, 200.\\n-148-\\nof novels written since Pamela have continued its basic pattern,\\nand concentrated their main interest upon a courtship leading to\\nmarriage.\\nPamela, it is true, departs from the usual pattern in one\\nimportant respect: even if we exclude Richardson\\'s ill-advised\\ncontinuation, the narrative does not end with the marriage, but\\ncontinues for some two hundred pages while every detail of the\\nmarriage ceremony and the resulting new conjugal pattern is\\nworked out according to Richardson\\'s exemplary specifications.\\nThis particular emphasis is odd to us, and suggests a lack of\\nformal proportion in the novel. Actually, it is probably a good\\npointer to Richardson\\'s real intentions: in 1740 the middleclass\\nconcept of marriage was not yet completely established, and\\nRichardson must have felt that his aim of producing a new model\\nof conduct for the relations between men and women involved\\npaying attention to many matters which we take for granted but\\non which there was not yet complete public agreement when he\\nwrote.\\nOne historical parallel to Richardson\\'s earnest redefinition of\\nmarriage is to be found in the sphere of law. In 1753 the\\nMarriage Bill, which laid the legal basis of modern practice, and\\nwhich, in the words of a Victorian historian, did much to improve\\n\\'the conjugal relations of the people of England, high and low\\', 1\\nwas introduced by Hardwick, the Lord Chancellor. Its main\\n151\\npurpose was to end the confusion about what constituted a legal\\nmarriage, and to effect this it laid down in unequivocal terms\\nthat a valid marriage, except under certain specified and very\\nexceptional circumstances, could only be performed by a\\nminister of the Church of England in the parish church after\\npublic reading of banns on three consecutive Sundays, and with\\nan official licence. 2\\nThis practice was already common; but, as the law had stood,\\nmarriages of mutual consent by word of mouth were also legal;\\nand -- more important -- so were secret marriages performed by\\nan ordained minister.

This is reflected in the increasing\\ntendency of booksellers and writers to address special appeals to\\nthe feminine audience. John Dunton founded the first periodical\\navowedly addressed to women, the Ladies\\' Mercury, in 1693:\\nand there were many other similar efforts, such as The Female\\nTatler in 1709 and Eliza Haywood Female Spectator in 1744.\\nAddison, too, had set himself out to please the ladies, and Steele\\nhad compiled The Ladies\\' Library in 1714, to give them\\nsomething more edifying than the frivolous material to which\\nthey were so often alleged to restrict themselves.\\nThat most women read only romances and novels, as was\\nendlessly asserted, is not likely. Many were certainly devoted to\\nreligious literature. But, at least as far as secular reading is\\nconcerned, it is likely that their lower educational standards\\nmade classical and learned literature out of the question for the\\ngreat majority, and that they therefore tended to devote much of\\n____________________\\n1 V I, 307-308, 354-365.\\n2 L etters and Works, II, 289.\\n-151-\\ntheir leisure to whatever lighter reading was available. The fact\\nthat \\'the novel-reading girl\\' became an established comic type\\nearly in the century, 1 with Biddy Tipkins in Steele The Tender\\nHusband ( 1705), certainly suggests that fiction was the main\\nreading of younger girls; but it is more likely that she was an\\nextreme case, and that most women read both fiction and more\\nserious matter. This mixture of tastes is suggested at one social\\nlevel by Shamela\\'s library which included various religious works\\nsuch as The Whole Duty of Man, as well as scabrous novels like\\nVenus in the Cloister; or the Nun in Her Smock. 2 At a higher\\nsocial level we have the representative feminine types Matilda\\nand Flavia in William Law A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy\\nLife ( 1729), whose shelves are well stocked both with piety and\\n153\\nwit; and many of the women in Richardson\\'s own circle combined\\nthese tastes. It is very likely, therefore, that one of the reasons\\nfor the success of Pamela was the way that it enabled readers to\\nenjoy the attractions both of fiction and of devotional literature\\nat the same time and in the same work.\\nIt would be very difficult to determine whether Richardson had\\nany conscious intention of appealing to these two elements in\\nfeminine literary taste. His correspondence about his own\\nwritings certainly shows a great and indeed almost obsessive\\ninterest in the public\\'s reaction to them; and one of his replies to\\nCheyne\\'s objection to the \\'fondling and gallantry\\' in Pamela\\nseems to cover the present point at issue: \\'if I were to be too\\nspiritual, I doubt I should catch none but the grandmothers; for\\nthe granddaughters would put my Girl indeed in better company,\\nsuch as that of the graver writers, and there they would leave\\nher\\'. 3 On the other hand, there is no need to assume that the\\nprofound interest in women\\'s problems which Richardson\\nmanifests in his novels is an attempt to please feminine taste, for\\neverything we know about his own personality and way of life\\nshows that he shared these tastes to a very remarkable degree.\\nHe was always happiest in feminine society, believing, as he\\nonce confided to Miss Highmore after the tedium of three\\nmeetings with his friend \\'the good Dr. Heberden\\', that \\'there is\\nnothing either improving or delightful out of the company of\\nintelligent women\\'. 4 He was very proud both of the fact that\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Reynolds, Learned Lady, pp. 400-419.\\n2 L etter12.\\n3 C it. McKillop, Richardson, p. 62.\\n4 I bid. p. 189.\\n-152-\\n\\'the tendency\\' of his works \\'was to exalt the sex\\', and of the\\nabundant homage with which he had been repaid; \\'no man\\', he\\nwrote, \\'has been so honoured by the fine spirits of the sex as I\\nhave been\\'. 1 Indeed, there is much in his letters to suggest that\\nhe had a deep personal identification with the opposite sex which\\nwent far beyond social preference or cultural rapport. Such,\\ncertainly, is the implication of the fact that he was afraid of mice,\\nor at least confessed to the future Mrs. Chapone, that he had\\never had a kind of natural aversion to that species of animal\\'. 2\\nOne reflection of Richardson\\'s closeness to the feminine point of\\n154\\nview is to be found in the wealth of minutely described domestic\\ndetail in Pamela. Many contemporary readers apparently\\nobjected to the \\'heap of trivial circumstances\\' in the novel; a\\ngentleman in a coffee-house ironically \\'wondered the Author had\\nnot told us the exact number of pins Pamela had about her when\\nshe set out for Lincolnshire, and how many rows of those pins\\nshe bought for a penny\\'; 3 while Fielding parodied Richardson\\'s\\nexplicitness about the least detail in matters of dress by making\\nShamela pack \\'one Clog and almost another\\' when she leaves\\nSquire Booby. 4 But if the men mocked, there can be little doubt\\nthat many feminine readers enjoyed these details for their own\\nsake; Madame Du Deffand, for example, particularly praised\\n\\'tous les détails domestiques\\' 5 and preferred Richardson\\'s novels\\nto the French romances on their account.\\nThe taste for domestic detail on the part of Richardson\\'s feminine\\naudience probably made an appreciable contribution to the\\nnarrative\\'s air of everyday reality; romance-heroines, for\\ninstance, had made journeys often enough, but none before\\nPamela\\'s had been so real as to confront them with the varied\\nperplexities of assembling a suitable travelling wardrobe. In\\nanother respect, however, Richardson\\'s closeness to the feminine\\npoint of view involved him in a very significant departure from\\nthe ordinary course of human life. Pamela\\'s marriage to one so\\nmuch above her economically and socially is an unprecedented\\nvictory for her sex; and although Mr. B. accepts his fate with a\\ngood grace the outcome cannot be regarded as bringing him\\nequally great satisfaction; the direction of the plot, in fact, out-\\n____________________\\n1 C orrespondence, IV, 233; V, 265.\\n2 C it.

The marriage of the protagonists usually\\nleads to a rise in the social and economic status of the bride, not\\nthe bridegroom. Hypergamy, though not a convention of modern\\nsociety, is a fairly constant convention of the novel; and its\\nultimate cause is surely the preponderance of women in the\\n155\\nnovel-reading public, a preponderance which this crucial detail of\\nits matrimonial mystique directly reflects.\\nV\\nRichardson Pamela, then, made a particular appeal to the\\nfeminine part of his audience; and we can now return to our\\nmain theme, and see how their marriage problems were such as\\nto provide rich literary resources. We have already seen that\\nnumerous forces in the social history of Richardson\\'s time were\\ntending to heighten interest in Pamela\\'s struggle to secure a\\nmate: these forces were also closely related to very significant\\nchanges in the accepted attitude towards the moral and\\npsychological roles of the sexes, changes which provide the\\nfundamental basis for Richardson\\'s presentation of his heroine\\'s\\ncharacter and mode of action. It is because of these changes\\nthat in Pamela the courtship, if that is not too risible a\\neuphemism for Mr. B.\\'s tactics, involves a struggle, not only\\nbetween two individuals, but between two opposed conceptions\\nof sex and marriage held by two different social classes, and\\nbetween two conceptions of the masculine and feminine roles\\nwhich make their interplay in courtship even more complex and\\nproblematic than it had previously been.\\nTo determine what exactly these conceptions were is not easy. It\\nis one of the general difficulties in applying social history to the\\ninterpretation of literature that, uncertain as our knowledge of\\nany particular social change may be, our knowledge of its\\nsubjective aspects, the way it affected the thoughts and feelings\\nof the individuals concerned, is even more insecure and\\nhypothetical. Yet the problem cannot altogether be avoided;\\nhowever important the external facts about the complexities of\\nthe social situation of women may have been, they presented\\nthemselves to Richardson in the form of the largely unconscious\\n-154-\\npresuppositions of the people around him; and it was presumably\\nthese social and psychological orientations which dictated the\\nway that his readers understood the thoughts and actions of the\\ncharacters in Pamela. It is necessary, therefore, to attempt to\\ndiscover what were the dominant considerations which formed\\nthe attitudes towards sex and marriage which are portrayed\\nthere.\\nOne of these attitudes we have already noted -- the tremendous\\nfascination of marriage and every detail connected with it for the\\n156\\nheroine; but this emphasis is complemented by another -- an\\nequally striking horror of any sexual advance or reference until\\nthe conjugal knot is tied. Both these tendencies are typical of\\nPuritanism.\\nThe assimilation of the values of romantic love to marriage, it\\nwas argued above, occurred particularly early in England, and\\nwas closely connected with the Puritan movement. Not, of\\ncourse, that Puritanism approved of romantic love, but that its\\nindividualist and anti-ecclesiastical type of religion caused it to\\nattribute supreme spiritual importance to the relation of man and\\nwife, as is suggested by the title of Defoe Religious Courtship:\\nBeing Historical Discourses on the Necessity of Marrying\\nReligious Husbands and Wives Only ( 1722). This emphasis on\\nthe need for spiritual harmony between man and wife was often\\ntransferred to the intrinsic qualities of the relationship itself: the\\nHallers have described how Milton, for example, proceeded from\\n\\'magnifying the religious significance of marriage\\' to magnifying\\n\\'the emotional, romantic, and idealistic aspects of the marriage\\nrelation\\'. 1\\nThe two attitudes, of course, may well be combined; and it must\\nbe added that -- whether they are combined or held separately -\\nthey are in no sense exclusively Puritan, and are found among\\nmany other Protestant sects. The idealisation of marriage is,\\nhowever, distinctively Protestant, since in Roman Catholicism the\\nhighest religious values are connected with celibacy; and given\\nthe characteristic strength of Puritanism in applying its theory to\\nevery detail of social organisation and individual psychology, it is\\nlikely that it was the strongest single force in developing the new\\nemphasis on the spiritual values of the marriage relationship, an\\nemphasis which may be regarded\\n____________________\\n1 W illiam and Malleville Haller, \"The Puritan Art of Love\", HLQ, V\\n( 1942), 265.\\n-155-\\nas the modern counterpart of the originally religious basis of\\ncourtly love.\\nPuritanism was certainly particularly vigorous in enforcing the\\ncomplementary attitude -- the sinfulness of all sexual activities\\noutside marriage. Wherever it achieved political power, in\\nGeneva, in Scotland, in New England, in England during the\\nCommonwealth period, it made rigorous inquiry into the sexual\\n157\\nbehaviour of individuals, arraigned offenders, forced them to\\nconfess their sins publicly, and punished them severely. The\\nclimax of this movement is probably the Act passed in England in\\n1650 which made adultery punishable by death. 1\\nIn this, as in many other matters, Puritanism was merely placing\\na particularly heavy emphasis on ideas which are not themselves\\npeculiar to it, and which reach back to the Pauline and\\nAugustinian elements in the Christian tradition. Man\\'s physical\\nnature and its desires were viewed as radically evil, the damnosa\\nhereditas of the Fall: consequently virtue itself tended to become\\na matter of suppressing the natural instincts. This -- in\\nPuritanism as in St. Paul -- was at first regarded merely as a\\nnegative step: to overcome the flesh might give the law of the\\nspirit a better chance to operate. Later, however, as\\nsecularisation increased, there arose a widespread tendency to\\nethical rigorism for its own sake, a tendency which is Puritan only\\nin the sense that Victorian morality was Puritan: resistance to\\nthe desires of the body became the major aim of secular\\nmorality; and chastity, instead of being only one virtue among\\nmany, tended to become the supreme one, and applied to men\\nas well as to women.\\nIt is interesting to notice that this particular ethical tendency is\\npeculiarly suited to an individualist society. Aristotle\\'s ethics are\\nlargely social; potential moral eminence varies according to the\\nindividual\\'s capacity for outstanding qualities of citizenship. Such\\na code, however, accords ill with a civilisation whose members\\nare primarily oriented towards achieving their own individual\\npurposes in the economic, social and religious spheres; and it is\\nparticularly unsuitable for the feminine sex, who had little more\\nopportunity in eighteenth-century England than in fourth-century\\nAthens to realise the virtues of the\\n____________________\\n1 G .

On the other hand, what\\nare often called the Puritan virtues, with their emphasis on\\nsexual continence, are wholly suited to an individualist social\\norder, and offer women as large possibilities of achievement as\\nmen.\\n158\\nIt is, at all events, very evident that the eighteenth century\\nwitnessed a tremendous narrowing of the ethical scale, a\\nredefinition of virtue in primarily sexual terms. Dr. Johnson, for\\nexample, held that \\'man\\'s chief merit consisted in resisting the\\nimpulses of nature\\'; 1 and these impulses, significantly, were\\nincreasingly identified with \\'the passion of love\\'. 2 Such,\\ncertainly, was Richardson\\'s view. Sir Charles Grandison\\'s mentor,\\nDr. Bartlett, \\'said that the life of a good man was a continual\\nwarfare with his passions\\', 3 and Richardson\\'s novels suggest\\nthat these passions are very largely sexual ones. The same\\ntendency can be seen at work on the ethical vocabulary itself:\\nwords such as virtue, propriety, decency, modesty, delicacy,\\npurity, came to have the almost exclusively sexual connotation\\nwhich they have since very largely retained.\\nOne aspect of this moral transformation which is particularly\\nimportant for Pamela is the eighteenth-century attack on the\\ndouble standard. Many women writers protested against the\\ninjustice it did their sex: Mrs. Manley, for example, attacked it in\\nThe New Atalantis ( 1709); 4 and in 1748 another erring matron,\\nLaetitia Pilkington, asked, \\'Is it not monstrous that our seducers\\nshould be our accusers?\\' 5 Most of the masculine reformers of the\\nage also campaigned against the still fashionable assumption\\nthat sexual purity was not so important for men as for women.\\nIn 1713 the Guardian \\'ventured to recommend to its readers\\nChastity as the noblest male virtue\\'; 6 and in the mid-century\\nRichardson, to the incredulous laughter of Colly Cibber, and the\\neven more scandalous consternation of some of the ladies, made\\nthe principle quite explicit by insisting that his ideal man, Sir\\nCharles Grandison, was a virgin until marriage. 7\\n____________________\\n1 \" Recollections\" of Miss Reynolds, Johnsonian Miscellanies, ed.\\nHill, II, 285.\\n2 S ee, for example, Mrs. Manley, Power of Love..., 1720, p. 353;\\nAnon, Reasons against Coition, 1732, p. 7; Ned Ward, The\\nLondon Spy ( 1698- 1709; London, 1927 ed.), p. 92.\\n3 I II, 251.\\n4 I I, 190-191.\\n5 M emoirs ( 1748; London, 1928 ed.), p. 103.\\nNo. 45.\\n7 s ee the anonymous pamphlet, possibly by Francis Plumer, A\\nCandid Examination of the History of Sir Charles Grandison,\\n1754, P. 48.\\n-157-\\n159\\nIn the matter of the double standard, as in many other aspects of\\nthe eighteenth-century concern with the reform of sexual morality,\\nthere were marked differences of attitude between classes, and it\\nwas, of course, the middle class which displayed the greatest zeal.\\nFor many reasons. In the history of mankind strictness in sexual\\nrelations tends to coincide with the increasing importance of private\\nproperty -- the bride must be chaste so that her husband can be\\nsure that it is his son who will inherit. This consideration must have\\nbeen particularly important to those whose values were primarily\\nthose of trade and commerce; and its effect was reinforced by at\\nleast two other features of middleclass life. There is, first of all, the\\nopposition between economic and sexual goals which was well\\nexplained by William Law when he remarked of his typical man of\\nbusiness, Negotius: \\'If you ask me what it is that has secured\\nNegotius from all scandalous vices, it is the same thing that has\\nkept him from all strictness of devotion, it is his great business\\'. 1\\nSecondly, the merchant or tradesman is likely to feel resentment\\nand mistrust against those whose way of life is not mainly directed\\ntowards economic ends, and who therefore have both the leisure\\nand the leisure attributes which enable them to pursue the wives\\nand daughters of the citizenry successfully, as the gallants of the\\ncourt and the polite end of the town so notoriously did.\\nFor these and many other reasons, which must certainly include a\\nlong history of political and religious conflict, sexual prowess and\\nsexual licence both tended to be linked with the aristocracy and the\\ngentry in middle-class belief. Defoe, for example, placed the\\nresponsibility for the immorality of the times squarely on the upper\\nclasses: \\'\\'Twas the Kings and the Gentry which first... degenerated\\nfrom that strict observation of moral virtues, and from thence\\ncarried vice on to that degree it now appears in.... We the poor\\nCommons... have really been debauched into vice by their\\nexamples.\\' 2\\nThe quotation is from The Poor Man\\'s Plea ( 1698), one of Defoe\\'s\\nmain contributions to the various moral crusades begun in the reign\\nof William and Mary by the new Societies for the Reformation of\\nManners. The most significant literary aspect of the work of these\\nsocieties was that whose most notable expression is Jeremy Collier\\nShort View of the Profaneness and Immoralityof the English Stage\\n____________________\\n1 S eriouy Call, Works ( Brockenhurst, 1892- 1893), IV, 121-122.\\n2 P . 6.\\n-158-\\n161\\nof the English Stage, also published in 1698. 1 It was natural that\\ndislike of upper-class licence should extend to the literature\\nwhich expressed it, and one result of this attitude was of\\nparticular importance to the development of the middle-class\\nsexual code. Many writers felt that the public should be warned\\nnot only against the flagrant immorality of the kind that Collier\\nattacked, but against the equally dangerous romantic concepts\\nthat underlay the sentiments of Restoration drama in general,\\nand that were used with sophisticated duplicity by the courtly\\nenemies of feminine virtue. Steele, for instance, pointed out that\\n\\'Notions of Gallantry\\' had latterly been \\'turned topsie-turvey, and\\nthe knight errantry of this profligate age is destroying as many\\nwomen as they can\\', 2 while in his Critical Essay Concerning\\nMarriage ( 1724) Thomas Salmon emphasised the dangers\\noccasioned by the ambiguities in the use of such words as\\n\\'honour and gallantry\\' in common speech. 3 Defoe, of course,\\npersistently puts before us the realities of sexual intrigue,\\nstripped of their conventional verbal decorations, and he mocks\\nromantic professions of love wherever they occur. This trend was\\ncontinued by Richardson, who included in his Familiar Letters on\\nImportant Occasions letters \\'ridiculing a romantic Rhapsody in\\nCourtship\\', 4 and who warned in Pamela that \\'Platonic Love is\\nPlatonic Nonsense\\'. 5\\nIf virtuous daughters were to be forced to see the sordid aims\\nthat were concealed behind what Eliza Haywood\\'s Alderman\\nSaving called \\'the romantic idle notions of the other end of the\\ntown\\', 6 even the word \\'love\\' was dangerous and its meaning had\\nto be clarified. Here Richardson made a characteristic\\ncontribution, in the Postscript to Clarissa: \\'What is too generally\\ncalled love ought (perhaps as generally) to be called by another\\nname\\', he wrote, and bitingly suggested as substitute \\'Cupidio or\\na Paphian stimulus... however grating they may be to delicate\\nears\\'.\\nThe need to outlaw the \\'Paphian stimulus\\' involved a redefinition\\nof the relations between men and women which excluded the\\nsexual passion, and which stressed making a sensible marriage\\nchoice with rational friendship as its eventual\\n____________________\\n1 S ee J.

Swift, for example, in his Letter to a Very Young Lady on\\nHer Marriage ( 1727) warned against expecting \\'any mixture of\\nthat ridiculous passion which has no being but in playbooks and\\nromances\\', and instead advocated a \\'match of prudence and\\ncommon good liking\\'. 1 This view was widely held in Richardson\\'s\\ncircle. His friend Dr. Delany, for example, wrote to his future wife\\nin 1743 that \\'perfect friendship is nowhere to be found but in\\nmarriage\\', 2 while Richardson himself, believing that \\'friendship...\\nis the perfection of love\\', 3 defined marriage as \\'the highest state\\nof friendship that mortals can know\\'. The climax of this trend\\nmust surely be the scene in Sir Charles Grandison where\\nRichardson celebrates the triumph of spiritual ties over those of\\nthe flesh, and even of marriage, by making Sir Charles and the\\ntwo rivals for his affections swear allegiance to a triangle of\\neternal friendship, and solemnly dedicate a temple in honour of\\ntheir compact. 4\\nSir Charles, unfortunately, was something of an exception as far\\nas the male sex was concerned, and as a result the campaign\\nagainst sexuality was forced to a peculiar compromise. As far as\\nMr. B. and his like were concerned, the best that could be hoped\\nfor was a social disciplining of the unregenerate Adam within by\\nmaking marriage the only permitted means of sexual expression:\\nPamela and her sex, however, with the exception of a few wholly\\nabandoned females, were reserved for higher things; the new\\nideology granted them a total immunity from sexual feelings, and\\nif they married it was not because they had any need of medicina\\nlibidinis, but because the pieties of marriage and the family were\\nsafe only in their hands.\\nThis particular biological discrimination is really something of a\\nhistorical novelty. It is, for example, in complete contradiction\\nboth to the patriarchal outlook and to the classic tradition of the\\nportrayal of love in our literature, from Chaucer Troilus and\\nCriseyde to Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet. Even more striking, it\\nis directly opposed to the earlier attitudes of Puritanism itself,\\nwhere such figures as Calvin, John Knox and Milton were\\nnotoriously prone to lay more emphasis on the concupiscence of\\nwomen than of men.\\nA different point of view, however, was already widely\\n____________________\\n162\\n1 P rose Works ( London, 1907), XI, 119.\\n2 M rs.

Defoe\\'s novels, for\\nexample, tend to support his stated view in The Review ( 1706)\\nthat \\'in our general Pursuit of the Sex, the Devil generally acts\\nthe Man, not the Woman\\'. 1 Exactly why the serpent\\'s invidious\\nconnection with Eve should have been forgotten is not clear; one\\ncan only surmise that, by a devious process not unknown to the\\npsychologist, the very difficulties in the situation of women at\\nthis time brought about a new concept of the feminine role which\\nmasked their actual dependence on sexual attractiveness to the\\nmale much more completely than before, and strengthened their\\ntactical position in courtship by making their acceptance of a\\nsuitor a matter, not of joint personal satisfaction, but of noblesse\\noblige.\\nThe question of the origins of this new sexual ideology is\\nobviously very problematic: but there is at least very little doubt\\nthat the appearance of Pamela marks a very notable epiphany in\\nthe history of our culture: the emergence of a new, fully\\ndeveloped and immensely influential stereotype of the feminine\\nrole. The nature and later sway of this ideal of womanhood is the\\nsubject of an excellent study, Pamela\\'s Daughters ( 1937), by R.\\nP. Utter and G. B. Needham. Briefly, they show how the model\\nheroine must be very young, very inexperienced, and so delicate\\nin physical and mental constitution that she faints at any sexual\\nadvance; essentially passive, she is devoid of any feelings\\ntowards her admirer until the marriage knot is tied -such is\\nPamela and such are most of the heroines of fiction until the end\\nof the Victorian period.\\nThe nature of this new stereotype, incidentally, reflects many of\\nthe social and economic trends described earlier. Even Pamela\\'s\\ntendency to faint, for example, may be regarded as an\\nexpression of the changing economic basis of marriage: for,\\nsince middle-class wives tended to be increasingly regarded as\\nleisure exhibits engaging in no heavier economic tasks than the\\nmore delicate and supervisory operations of housewifery, a\\nconspicuously weak constitution was both an assertion of a\\ndelicately nurtured past and a presumptive claim to a similar\\nfuture. It is true that Pamela\\'s humble birth hardly entitles her to\\n163\\nthis trait; but in fact her full possession of it only shows that her\\ntotal being has been so deeply shaped by ideas above her station\\nthat even her body exhibits -- to invoke the assistance of\\n____________________\\n1 R eview, III ( 1706), No. 132.\\n-161-\\na neologism for which there is in any case a regrettable need -- a\\nnot uncommon form of what can only be called sociosomatic\\nsnobbery.\\nThe conception of the feminine role represented in Pamela is an\\nessential feature of our civilisation over the past two hundred\\nyears. Margaret Mead writes in Sex and Temperament that this\\ncivilisation has largely \\'relied for the creation of rich and\\ncontrasted values upon many artificial distinctions, the most\\nstriking of which is sex\\'. 1 I have no wish to suggest that this\\nparticular distinction had previously escaped notice, nor even\\nthat it is wholly artificial; but it is surely true that the conception\\nof sex we find in Richardson embodies a more complete and\\ncomprehensive separation between the male and female roles\\nthan had previously existed.\\nThe difference between the two roles is emphasised in almost\\nevery aspect of speech and manners. Richardson\\'s friend, Dr.\\nJohnson, was of \\'opinion that the delicacy of the sex shou\\'d\\nalways be inviolably preserved, in eating, in exercise, in dress, in\\neverything\\'; 2 while Richardson himself -- who in Pamela was\\nresponsible for the first use of the word \\'indelicacy\\' 3 -- was an\\navowed reformer in this sphere: \\'I would fain reduce delicacy to\\na standard\\', he wrote to Miss Highmore, but quickly corrected\\nhimself: \\'Reduce did I say? Should not exalt be the word?\\' 4\\nSome further indication of his attitude is provided early in\\nPamela when Mr. B. gives the heroine some of her dead\\nmistress\\'s clothes: she is acutely embarrassed, and when he\\nsays, \\'Don\\'t blush, Pamela, dost think I don\\'t know pretty maids\\nshould wear shoes and stockings\\', she reports that \\'I was so\\nconfounded at these words, you might have beat me down with a\\nfeather\\'. Later, when her parents hear of Mr. B.\\'s \\'free\\nexpressions about the stockings\\' they at once fear the worst. 5\\nThis linguistic sensitivity seems to be a rather new phenomenon.\\nTo some extent, no doubt, the language of women and of mixed\\ncompany has always tended to be somewhat different from that\\nof men, but these differences had not been so obvious before.

His rewriting of L\\'Estrange\\'s\\nversion of Aesop reveals him as one of our earliest bowdlerisers,\\n7 and his novels show a considerable concern for the proprieties\\nof the feminine linguistic code. When Pamela becomes pregnant,\\nfor instance, she is shocked to find that Lady Davers \\'in her\\nquality way\\' 8 takes public note of the fact: but then Lady\\nDavers, of course, is one of those \\'termagant, hermaphrodite\\nminds\\' attacked in the \\'Introduction to the Second Edition\\'; 9 and\\nshe is also a symbol of the notorious impurity of \\'the quality\\'.\\nWhat may be called the decarnalisation of the public feminine\\nrole provides a further explanation of the fact that in Pamela as\\n165\\nin most novels the courtship leads to a rise in the social status\\n____________________\\n1 S hort View, 3rd ed., 1698, p. 8.\\n2 C it.

Male readers would\\npresumably prefer to see the hero win the hand of some noble\\nlady; but a moment\\'s reflection shows that such a gratification\\ncould not be afforded without forcing upon the heroine a grave\\nbreach of feminine decorum.\\nThis point is raised in a discussion between Lady Davers and Mr.\\nB. He argues that his mesalliance is in no sense as shocking as it\\nwould be if the roles were reversed, since \\'a woman, tho\\' ever so\\nnobly born, debases herself by a mean marriage\\'. 1 This was the\\naccepted view; so humane a man as Dr. Johnson, for instance,\\nregarded it as a \\'perversion\\' for a woman to marry beneath her. 2\\nThe reason for this is clear. Mr. B. can properly follow his fancy\\nand marry beneath his station because it is undeniable and\\nirremediable fact that men are subject to the sexual passion; but\\nfor a woman to do so would amount to an admission that she\\nhad lost her immunity from sexual feeling, an immunity which is\\none of the peculiar constants in the heroines of English fiction\\nfrom Pamela until recently, and whose sudden collapse was such\\na startling feature of the twentieth-century novel.\\nVI\\nDuring Richardson\\'s lifetime, then, many important and complex\\nchanges in the ways that the sexes oriented themselves to their\\nroles were already far advanced. These changes are of\\nconsiderable intrinsic interest, since they herald the\\nestablishment of what is substantially the concept of courtship,\\nmarriage and the feminine role that has obtained most widely in\\nthe last two centuries. The reason for our interest in them here,\\n166\\nhowever, is of a more directly literary nature: it derives from the\\nfact that these social and psychological changes go far to explain\\ntwo of the major qualities posed by Pamela: its formal unity, and\\nits peculiar combination of moral purity and impurity.\\nDr. Johnson, with the novella in mind, defined a \\'novel\\' as a\\n\\'small tale, generally of love\\'. When Pamela appeared it was\\ncalled a \\'dilated novel\\', 3 because its subject was essentially the\\nsingle amorous episode which previous short novels had usually\\n____________________\\n1 I , 389.\\n2 B oswell, Life, ed.

In Defoe\\'s\\nnovels sexual encounters, marital or otherwise, are treated as\\nminor episodes within the larger context of the pursuit of\\neconomic security. Moll Flanders is \\'tricked once by that cheat\\ncalled love\\', 1 but it is a beginning, not an end; while Colonel\\nJacque comments on his faithful wife Moggy\\'s \\'slip in her younger\\ndays\\' that \\'it was of small consequence to me one way or\\nanother\\'. 2\\nIn the world of Pamela such off-handedness is inconceivable, for\\nthere, in the words of Henry Brooke,\\nThe woman no redemption knows The wounds of honour never\\nclose. 3\\nMr. B., of course, regards Pamela\\'s acceptance of such a view as\\nevidence that her \\'head is turned by romances and such idle\\nstuff\\', but he is wrong. The ideal chastity of the romance\\nheroines had been very completely incorporated into the general\\nmoral outlook; it was in much more humdrum literary sources\\nthat Pamela had \\'read that many a man has been ashamed of his\\nwicked attempts, when he has been repulsed\\', and chanced \\'a\\nnight or two before\\' upon the crucial slogan which she announces\\n167\\nin appropriate circumstances -- \\'May I never survive, one\\nmoment, that fatal one in which I shall forfeit my innocence!\\' It\\nwas also, presumably, from some conduct book, although this\\ntime no literary indebtedness is acknowledged, that Pamela\\nlearned that \\'Millions of gold will not purchase one happy\\nmoment of reflection on a past mis-spent life\\'. 4\\nDefoe\\'s heroines, of course, would not have thought twice, even\\nfor rewards much less than Mr. B.\\'s five hundred guineas: the\\nnovel is born because Pamela makes her epic resistance to a\\n\\'fate worse than death\\', that significantly euphemistic hyperbole\\nwhich loomed so large in the later history of fiction.\\nThere is, of course, nothing inherently new in making a fictional\\nheroine regard her chastity as a supreme value; what\\n____________________\\n1 I , 57.\\n2 E d.

It is this historical and literary perspective\\nwhich makes clear the importance of Pamela: Richardson\\'s novel\\nrepresents the first complete confluence of two previously\\nopposed traditions in fiction; it combines \\'high\\' and \\'low\\' motives,\\nand, even more important, it portrays the conflict between the\\ntwo.\\nRichardson thus initiated the novel\\'s radical departure from the\\nStiltrennung in the crucial area of sexual relations. Not only so:\\nhe also broke down the separation of \\'high\\' and \\'low life\\' -the\\nclass aspect of the Stiltrennung, and for the same reason. The\\nmovement for moral reform, we have seen, tended to be mainly\\nsupported by the middle class, who fortified their outlook as a\\ngroup with the assumption that their social superiors were their\\nmoral inferiors. This, of course, is the situation in Pamela -- the\\nrakish squire versus the humble but virtuous maid -- and it lends\\nthe story a much larger significance than the purely individual\\nmatters at issue between the protagonists.\\n168\\nThis use of the conflict between social classes is typical of the\\nnovel in general; its literary mode is radically particular, but it\\nachieves a universality of meaning by making its individual\\nactions and characters represent larger social issues. Defoe\\'s\\nplots are not such as to allow the relationships between his\\ncharacters to go very far in developing this type of significance,\\nwhereas the much greater simplicity of the action of Pamela\\nmakes it far easier for the struggles of Pamela and Mr. B. to\\nmirror larger contemporary conflicts between two classes and\\ntheir way of life.\\nThe enactment of the triumph of the middle-class code in sexual\\nethics brings with it, not only Mr. B.\\'s offer of marriage, but his\\ncomplete re-education in the proper attitudes to sex and\\nmarriage. These, of course, are mainly a matter of subjective\\npersonal values, and their adjustment involves a progressive\\nrevelation throughout the novel of the inner lives of the\\nprotagonists which continues until the hero\\'s conversion is so\\ncomplete that he becomes a \\'Puritan\\' 1 as far as Lady Davers is\\nconcerned.\\n____________________\\nI, 391.\\n-166-\\nThe relationship between Pamela and Mr. B. is therefore able to\\ndevelop a much richer psychological and moral content than that\\nbetween the traditional lovers in romance. The barriers between\\nthem that have to be broken down are not external and\\ncontrived but internal and real; and for this reason, combined\\nwith the fact that these barriers are based on the differences in\\ntheir respective class outlooks, the dialogue between the lovers\\nis not, as it is in romance, a conventional exercise in rhetoric, but\\nan exploration of the forces that have made them what they are.\\nThere is one final and very important contribution to the\\nstructure of Pamela which is directly related both to the\\nmiddleclass Puritan sexual code, and to the major difference\\nbetween that code and the tradition of courtly love.\\nCourtly love separated the sexual roles in a similar way-the\\ncarnal male adored the godlike purity of the female, and the\\ncontradiction between the two roles was absolute. In theory, at\\nleast; for if the lady yielded to her lover\\'s suit it meant a total\\nbreakdown of the convention. Puritanism, however, by providing\\nmarriage with a large spiritual and social meaning, provided a\\n169\\npossible bridge between the spirit and the flesh, between the\\nconvention and social reality. The bridge was not an easy one,\\nbecause, as Richardson had explained in his popular contribution\\nto the Rambler in 1751, the feminine role in courtship made it\\nimmoral as well as impolitic for a girl to allow herself to feel love\\nfor a suitor until he had actually asked for her hand in marriage.\\n1 The very difficulty, however, and the sudden reversal of the\\nlady\\'s attitude which was implied, supplied Richardson with a\\nvital plot resource, since it made it possible for Richardson to\\nwithhold from us any idea of Pamela\\'s real feelings towards Mr.\\nB. until the crisis in the action.\\nWhen Pamela leaves him to return to her parents it appears\\ncertain that all is over between them; actually a countermovement\\nat once begins. On the one hand, she is surprised to\\ndiscover \\'something so strange... so unexpected\\' in her feelings\\nthat she is forced to wonder whether she is not in fact sorry to\\nbe leaving; 2 on the other hand, Mr. B.\\'s deepest feelings, as\\nrevealed in his parting letter, show that he is not merely the\\n____________________\\n1 N o. 97.

These sudden revelations of the disparity between\\nthe conventional and the actual attitudes of the lovers thus\\nenabled Richardson to work out their relationship in a plot of the\\ntype which Aristotle considered to be the best, a complex action\\nin which the peripety and the recognition coincide. The dramatic\\nresolution of the plot of Pamela, in fact, was made possible by\\nthe actual moral and social attitudes of the time, which had\\nproduced an unprecedented disparity between the conventional\\nroles of the sexes and the actual tenor of the oracles of the\\nheart.\\nThis conflict between public and private attitudes is one with\\nwhich the novel in general has been much concerned, and which\\nit is indeed peculiarly fitted to portray. There is, however,\\nconsiderable doubt as to how far Richardson was aware of the\\nduplicities involved in the feminine role, or as to how we should\\n171\\ninterpret the narrative which embodies them.\\nAs is well known, Pamela has always been subject to very\\ncontradictory interpretations. Soon after its first publication one\\nanonymous pamphleteer reported that there were, \\'particularly\\namong the ladies, two different parties, Pamelists and\\nAntipamelists\\', who disagreed as to \\'whether the young virgin\\nwas an example for ladies to follow... or... a hypocritical crafty\\ngirl... who understands the art of bringing a man to her lure\\'. 1\\nThe most famous work in the controversy, of course, is Shamela,\\nwhere, as his title implies, Fielding interpreted Richardson\\'s\\nheroine as a hypocrite whose masterly deployment of the\\nresources of the feminine role enabled her to entrap a rich booby\\ninto marriage, although her purity did not in fact go beyond the\\nconventional public pretence suggested by Mrs. Lucretia Jarvis\\nwhen she speaks of the need to avoid \\'what we women call rude,\\nwhen done in the presence of others\\'. 2\\nFielding\\'s pamphlet certainly draws attention to an important\\nambiguity in Pamela, but when later critics suggest that we must\\nchoose between Fielding\\'s interpretation or Richardson\\'s they are\\nsurely overlooking the possibility that the ambiguity need not\\nspring from conscious duplicity on Pamela\\'s part, since it is\\nimplicit in the feminine code by which she acts. It seems evident,\\n____________________\\n1 T he Tablet, or Picture of Real Life, 1762, p. 14.\\nLetter VII.\\n-168-\\nfor example, that the code\\'s tremendous emphasis on the\\ndifferentiation of the sexes in behaviour and dress is open to a\\nvery similar criticism to that which Fielding made of Pamela.\\n\\'Decency\\', as Bernard Shawhas reminded us, \\'is indecency\\'s\\nconspiracy of silence\\', and the concern of the eighteenthcentury\\nmoralists with feminine purity suggests imaginations only too\\nready to colour everything with impure sexual significances.\\nSarah Fielding speaks in Ophelia ( 1760) of how Mrs. Darkins\\nthought a \\'girl ought not to set eyes on a baby that was not of\\nthe feminine gender\\'; 1 the corrupt assumptions of this attitude\\nare made clear when we remember that it is the lecherous Lady\\nWishfort in Congreve\\'s Way of the World who prided herself on\\nnot allowing her infant daughter to play with little boys. 2\\nSimilarly, we can interpret Addison\\'s campaign against naked\\nbosoms in the Guardian 3 by recalling that Tartuffe\\'s unhealthy\\n171\\nprurience is revealed by his throwing a handkerchief over\\nDorine\\'s breasts, 4 and Bridget Allworthy\\'s by her scandalised\\noutcry against the revelatory Sunday finery of the farmers\\'\\ndaughters. 5 Richardson\\'s own mind was certainly obsessed with\\nsex in a similar way, as we can see in some of his own\\npronouncements on sexual modesty. In the Familiar Letters, for\\nexample, writing in the guise of an uncle, he chides his niece\\'s\\n\\'manly air\\' in these terms: \\'I have been particularly offended . . .\\nat your new riding-habit; which is made so extravagantly in the\\nmode, that one cannot easily distinguish your sex by it. For you\\nlook neither like a modest girl in it, nor an agreeable boy.\\' 6\\nThe ambivalent implications of a conspicuous concern for\\nfeminine modesty suggest themselves with equal force in the\\ncase of Richardson\\'s heroine. It is certainly tempting to explain\\nher continual concern with decency of dress, for example, by\\nreference to the views of Dr. Gregory, an influential exponent of\\nthe new feminine code: in his Father\\'s Legacy to His Daughters (\\n1774) he concluded his warnings against \\'denudation\\' with the\\nMachiavellian parenthesis -- \\'The finest bosom in nature is not so\\nfine as what imagination forms\\'. 7 Be that as it may, there is at\\nleast no doubt that Mr. B. finds Pamela\\'s virtuous\\n____________________\\nII, 42.\\nAct V, sc. v.\\n3 N o. 116 ( 1713).\\n4 T artuffe, Act III, sc. ii.\\n5 T om Jones, Bk.

It is surely better to regard her as a real\\nperson whose actions are the result of the complexities of her\\nsituation and of the effects, both conscious and unconscious, of\\nthe feminine code. Steele pointed out that prude and coquette\\nare alike in that they have \\'the distinction of sex in all their\\nthoughts, words and actions\\': 1 the code that commanded the\\n172\\nallegiance of Pamela and her author is itself open to either\\ninterpretation. Similarly, although Pamela\\'s acceptance of Mr. B.\\nas a husband suggests that she regards his early advances as\\nless heinous than she could publicly admit at the time, the\\ninconsistency can be fully explained as the result of the falsity of\\nthe public code, rather than of her own character. Certainly if we\\ncondemn Pamela for such departures from absolute openness\\nand sincerity in courtship, we must not forget how widely the\\ncharge could be brought against others in similar circumstances,\\nboth in her age and in ours.\\nRichardson\\'s own attitude is difficult to determine. Like his\\nheroine, he is alternately fascinated and repelled by Mr. B.\\'s\\nlicentious attempts, and his moral protestations are not wholly\\nconvincing. As an artist, however, Richardson seems to have\\nbeen more aware of both points of view with respect to Pamela\\'s\\nsexual ethics than has been generally recognised, although he\\nimplicitly disavows the opposite position by making the odious\\nMrs. Jewkes its most vocal representative. When Pamela, for\\nexample, remarks that \\'to rob a person\\' of her virtue is worse\\nthan cutting her throat\\' she answers with an incomprehension\\nwhich, though lamentable, is not without illustrious precedent:\\n\\'Why now, how strangely you talk! Are not the two sexes made\\nfor one another? Is it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty\\nwoman? And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as\\ncutting her throat?\\' The remark would not be out of place in\\nShamela; nor would Mrs. Jewkes\\'s contemptuous retort when\\nPamela begs her not to let the master in lest she be undone -\\n\\'Mighty piece of undone!\\' 2\\n____________________\\n1 C it. Pamela\\'s Daughters, p. 64.\\n2 P amela, I, 95-96, 174.\\n-170-\\nAs a novelist, then, Richardson is capable of considerable\\nobjectivity; but it is clear that as a conscious moralist he is\\ncompletely on the side of Pamela, and it is here that the most\\nserious objections to his novel arise. His sub-title, \\'Virtue\\nRewarded\\', draws attention to the immitigable vulgarity of the\\nbook\\'s moral texture; it is surely evident that Pamela is in any\\ncase chaste only in a very technical sense which is of scant\\ninterest to the morally perceptive, and that Fielding hit upon the\\nmajor moral defect of the story when he made Shamela remark:\\n\\'I thought once of making a little fortune by my person. I now\\nintend to make a great one by my vartue.\\' 1 As to Mr. B.\\'s\\n173\\nvaunted reformation it is difficult to see that it amounts to any\\nmore than a promise, in Mandeville\\'s words, \\'never to be a deerstealer,\\nupon condition that he shall have venison of his own\\'. 2\\nMandeville, of course, was the self-appointed agent provocateur\\nof the bourgeois unconscious, determined to draw attention to all\\nthe perplexities in public morality which Addison and Richardson\\nwere determined to ignore; and his cynical analogy brings us\\nback to the very considerable extent to which the problems\\nraised by Richardson\\'s treatment of marriage are typical of\\nmodern Western culture as a whole. If we continue our\\ncomparison of Pamela with Chaucer\\'s Troilus and Criseyde or\\nShakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet it is surely apparent that\\nalthough Richardson is much purer in his language and his overt\\nattitudes, his work nevertheless concentrates much more\\nexclusively on the sexual relationship itself. This combination has\\nhad a very wide currency in fiction since then and has even\\nspread to the cinema. In the Hollywood film, as in the type of\\npopular fiction which Richardson initiated, we have an\\nunprecedentedly drastic and detailed Puritan censorship in\\nconjunction with a form of art which is historically unique in its\\nconcentration on arousing sexual interests: while in it marriage\\nfigures as the moral deus ex machina which, as James Fordyce\\nsaid of marriage in comedy, \\'is converted into a sponge, to wipe\\nout in a single stroke the stain of guilt\\'. 3\\nThe cause of this duality -- in Richardson\\'s time as in ours -is\\npresumably that the tabooed object is always an indication of the\\ndeepest interest of the society that forbids. All the forces that\\ncombined to intensify the prohibitions against sexual activity\\n____________________\\nShamela, Letter 10\\n3 S ermons to Young Women, 1766, I, 156.\\n-171-\\noutside marriage, tended in practice to increase the importance\\nof sex in the total picture of human life. That they did so in\\nRichardson was suggested by one of his contemporary critics, the\\nanonymous \\'Lover of Virtue\\' who produced some Critical\\nRemarks on Sir Charles Grandison, Clarissa and Pamela( 1754).\\nHe coupled the fact that \\'Love, eternal Love, is the subject, the\\nburthen of all your writings\\' with Richardson\\'s tremendous\\naccentuation of what he called the \\'political chastity\\' about which\\n\\'you and your heroines make such a rout and a pother\\', a\\n174\\nchastity which in his opinion compared very unfavourably with\\nthat of the women of ancient Greece. Even so, the writer was at\\na loss to understand why so many \\'public-spirited penmen\\'\\nthought it necessary to employ \\'all their art and eloquence to\\nkeep people in remembrance, that they were composed of\\ndifferent sexes\\' when \\'provident nature\\' unassisted could be\\ntrusted to \\'prevent the world from coming to an end\\'. 1 The\\nexplanation, of course, was that the repression of the instincts of\\n\\'provident nature\\', combined with the increasing concealment of\\nwhat our culture, with eloquent indirection, calls \\'the facts of life\\',\\nproduced needs in the public which had to be gratified. One of\\nthe main functions of the novel since Richardson, it may be\\nsuggested, has been to serve a fictional initiation rite into the\\nmost fundamental mystery of its society.\\nOnly by some such hypothesis can we explain the later course of\\nthe novel, or the remarkable paradox that Richardson, a leader\\nin the crusade for sexual reform, and an avowed enemy of love\\nboth in its romantic and fleshly aspects, should have signalised\\nhis entry into the history of literature by a work which gave a\\nmore detailed account of a single amorous intrigue than had ever\\nbeen produced before. It would seem that the opposite qualities\\nin Richardson\\'s outlook, his Puritanism and his prurience, are the\\nresult of the same forces, and this no doubt explains why their\\neffects are so intricately connected. The complexities of the\\nforces juxtaposed are largely responsible for the unique literary\\nqualities which Pamela brought into fiction: they make possible a\\ndetailed presentation of a personal relationship enriched by a\\nseries of developing contrasts between the ideal and the real, the\\napparent and the actual, the spiritual and the physical, the\\nconscious and the unconscious. But if the latent ambiguities of\\nthe sexual code helped Richardson\\n____________________\\nPp. 38, 35, 27-30, 39.\\n-172-\\nto produce the first true novel, they at the same time conspired\\nto create something that was new and prophetic in quite another\\nsense: a work that could be praised from the pulpit and yet\\nattacked as pornography, a work that gratified the reading public\\nwith the combined attractions of a sermon and a striptease.\\n-173-\\nCHAPTER VI\\nPrivate Experience and the Novel\\n175\\nAARON HILL was perhaps the most ebullient member of the\\nvociferous Richardsonclaque, but when he announced that \\'a\\nforce that can tear the heartstrings\\' had appeared \\'to gild the\\nhorror of our literary midnight\\' 1 he was only slightly\\nexaggerating the emotional enthusiasm with which Pamela and\\nClarissa were received by most of his contemporaries both in\\nEngland and abroad. 2 We have already seen that one reason for\\nthis enthusiasm was the way that Richardson\\'s subjectmatter\\nendeared him to feminine readers; but the men, on the whole,\\nseem to have been almost equally excited, and so we must seek\\nfor further explanations.\\nOne fairly common view has been that Richardson\\'s novels\\ngratified the sentimental tendencies of his age. \\'Sentimentalism\\'\\nin its eighteenth-century sense denoted an un-Hobbesian belief\\nin the innate benevolence of man, a credo which had the literary\\ncorollary that the depiction of such benevolence engaged in\\nphilanthropic action or generous tears was a laudable aim. There\\nare undoubtedly features in Richardson\\'s work which are\\n(sentimental\\' in this as well as in the current sense, but the term\\nis nevertheless somewhat misleading when applied either to his\\nown outlook or to the characteristic literary quality of his novels.\\nFor, as we have seen, Richardson\\'s moral theory was opposed to\\nthe cult of love and emotional release in general, while in his\\npractice as a novelist he presented a much wider range of\\nfeelings than those to which the sentimentalists proper usually\\nrestricted themselves. What is distinctive about Richardson\\'s\\nnovels is not the kind or even the amount of emotion, but rather\\nthe authenticity of its presentation: many writers of the period\\ntalked about \\'sympathetic tears\\'; even more deplorably\\nRichardson talked about \\'pellucid fugitives\\', 3 but he made them\\nflow as no one else and as never before.\\nHow Richardson made them flow, how he involved his\\n____________________\\n1 L etter to Richardson, March 8, 1749 (Forster MSS.

The consequence is, that we are only acquainted\\nwith their characters in their dress of ceremony, and that, as we\\nnever see them except in those critical circumstances, and those\\nmoments of strong emotion, which are but of rare occurrence in\\nreal life, we are never deceived into any belief of their reality,\\nand contemplate the whole as an exaggerated and dazzling\\nillusion. With such authors we make a visit by appointment, and\\nsee and hear only what we know has been prepared for our\\nreception. With Richardson, we slip, invisible, into the domestic\\nprivacy of his characters, and hear and see every thing that is\\nsaid and done among them, whether it be interesting or\\notherwise, and whether it gratify our curiosity or disappoint it.\\nWe sympathise with the former, therefore, only as we\\nsympathise with the monarchs and statesmen of history, of\\nwhose condition as individuals we have but a very imperfect\\nconception. We feel for the latter, as for our private friends and\\nacquaintance, with whose whole situation we are familiar. . . . In\\nthis art Richardson is undoubtedly without an equal, and, if we\\nexcept De Foe, without a competitor, we believe, in the whole\\nhistory of literature. 1\\nOne of the constituents of the narrative method described by\\nJeffrey was noted in the first chapter-the more minutely\\ndiscriminated time-scale, and the much less selective attitude to\\nwhat should be told the reader, which are characteristic of\\nRichardson\\'s formal realism. But this unselective amplitude of\\npresentation does not alone explain how Richardson enables us\\nto \\'slip into the domestic privacy of the characters\\': we must\\ntake account of the direction as well as of the scale of his\\nnarrative. This direction, of course, is towards the delineation of\\nthe domestic life and the private experience of the characters\\nwho belong to it: the two go together-we get inside their minds\\nas well as inside their houses.\\nIt is primarily this re-orientation of the narrative perspective\\nwhich gives Richardson his place in the tradition of the novel. It\\ndistinguishes him from Defoe, for example: since although both\\nwriters were, as Mrs. Barbauld wrote, \\'accurate describers,\\nminute and circumstantial... the minuteness of Defoe was more\\nemployed about things, and that of Richardson about\\n____________________\\n1 C ontributions to the Edinburgh Review ( London, 1844), I,\\n321-322.\\n-175-\\n177\\npersons and sentiments\\'. 1 In combination with his fullness of\\npresentation it also distinguishes him from the rival French\\nclaimants to the paternity of the modern novel. When George\\nSaintsbury, for example, concludes that Pamela is indeed the\\nfirst novel, he does so because the only answer he can give to\\nthe question \\'Where are we to find a probable human being,\\nworked out to the same degree, before?\\' is -- \\'Nowhere\\'. 2 There\\nare many equally probable and perhaps more interesting\\ncharacters in literature before Pamela, but there are none whose\\ndaily thoughts and feelings we know so intimately.\\nWhat forces influenced Richardson in giving fiction this subjective\\nand inward direction? One of them is suggested by the formal\\nbasis of his narrative-the letter. The familiar letter, of course,\\ncan be an opportunity for a much fuller and more unreserved\\nexpression of the writer\\'s own private feelings than oral converse\\nusually affords, and the cult of such correspondence was one\\nwhich had largely arisen during Richardson\\'s own lifetime, and\\nwhich he himself both followed and fostered.\\nIn itself it involved a very significant departure from the classical\\nliterary perspective; as Madame de Staël wrote, \\'the ancients\\nwould never have thought of giving their fiction such a form\\'\\nbecause the epistolary method \\'always presupposes more\\nsentiment than action\\'. 3 Richardson\\'s narrative mode, therefore,\\nmay also be regarded as a reflection of a much larger change in\\noutlook-the transition from the objective, social and public\\norientation of the classical world to the subjective, individualist\\nand private orientation of the life and literature of the last two\\nhundred years.\\nThe contrast is a fairly familiar one. It is implied in Hegel\\'s\\ncomparison between ancient and modern tragedy, or in Goethe\\'s\\nand Matthew Arnold\\'s yearning for the impersonality and\\nobjectivity of Greek and Roman art, as opposed to the feverish\\nsubjectivity of their own romantic literature; and its most\\nimportant aspect from our point of view is expressed by Walter\\nPater in Marius the Epicurean, when he comments on how the\\nancients were \\'jealous for the most part of affording us a glimpse\\nof that interior self, which in many cases would have actually\\ndoubled the interest of their objective informations\\'. 4\\n____________________\\n1 \" Life\", prefixed to Correspondence of Samuel Richardson, 1,\\nxx.\\n2 T he English Novel ( London, 1913), pp. 86-87.\\n3 \" De l\\'Allemagne\", in uvres complites, XI, 86-87.\\n178\\n4 L ondon, 1939, p. 313.\\n-176-\\nSome of the most important causes of the very different modern\\nemphasis have already been mentioned. Christianity in general,\\nfor example, was essentially an inward, individualist and selfconscious\\nkind of religion, and its effects were strongest in\\nPuritanism, with its stress on the inner light; while the\\nindispensable Madame de Staël drew attention to the influence of\\nthe changed philosophical outlook of the seventeenth century on\\nthe novel\\'s subjective and analytic approach to character: \\'ce\\nn\\'est même que depuis deux siècles que la philosophie s\\'est\\nassez introduite en nous-mêmes pour que l\\'analyse de ce qu\\'on\\néprouve tienne une si grande place dans les livres\\'. 1 The\\nsecularisation of thought which accompanied the new philosophy\\ntended in the same direction: it produced an essentially\\nmancentred world, and one in which the individual was\\nresponsible for his own scale of moral and social values.\\nFinally, the rise of individualism is of great importance. By\\nweakening communal and traditional relationships, it fostered\\nnot only the kind of private and egocentric mental life we find in\\nDefoe\\'s heroes, but also the later stress on the importance of\\npersonal relationships which is so characteristic both of modern\\nsociety and of the novel -- such relationships may be seen as\\noffering the individual a more conscious and selective pattern of\\nsocial life to replace the more diffuse, and as it were involuntary,\\nsocial cohesions which individualism had undermined.\\nIndividualism also contributed to Richardson\\'s emphasis on\\nprivate experience in at least two other respects: it provided an\\naudience deeply enough interested in all the processes that occur\\nin the individual consciousness to find Pamela absorbing; and its\\neconomic and social development eventually led to the\\ndevelopment of the urban way of life, a fundamental formative\\ninfluence on modern society which seems to be connected in\\nmany ways with the private and subjective tendency both of\\nRichardson personally and of the novel form in general.\\nI\\nEighteenth-century London had an importance in the national life\\nof the time that was unequalled elsewhere. Throughout the\\nperiod it was over ten times as large as any\\n____________________\\n1 \" De l\\'Allemagne\", p. 87.\\n179\\n-177-\\nother town in England, 1 and, perhaps even more important, it\\nwas there that such social changes as the rise of economic\\nindividualism, the increase in the division of labour, and the\\ndevelopment of the conjugal family, were most advanced; while,\\nas we have seen, it also contained a very large proportion of the\\nreading public -- from 1700 to 1760 over half of the booksellers\\nof England were established there. 2\\nThe continual increase of the size of London was noted by many\\nobservers. They were especially struck by the proliferation of\\nbuildings beyond the ancient limits of the twin cities of London\\nand Westminster, which became particularly evident after the\\nGreat Fire of 1666. 3 Fashion moved westward and northward,\\nwhile to the east settlements arose which were almost\\nexclusively inhabited by the labouring poor. This increasing\\nsegregation of classes was commented on by many writers.\\nAddison remarks in the Spectator are particularly significant:\\n\\'When I consider this great city in its several quarters and\\ndivisions, I look upon it as an aggregate of several nations,\\ndistinguished from each other by their respective customs,\\nmanners and interests. . . . In short, the inhabitants of St.\\nJames\\'s, notwithstanding they live under the same laws, and\\nspeak the same language, are a distinct people from those of\\nCheapside, who are likewise removed from those of the Temple\\non the one side, and those of Smithfield on the other.\\' 4\\nThis process -- the growth of London and its accompanying social\\nand occupational differentiation -- has been seen as \\'perhaps the\\nmost important single feature of the social history of the late\\nStuart period\\'. 5 It is at least the plainest of many indications\\nthat something approaching the modern urban pattern was\\ngradually imposing itself on the more cohesive community that\\nShakespeare knew: and we should therefore expect to find that\\nsome of the distinctive psychological features of modern\\nurbanisation began to manifest themselves at the same time. 6\\n____________________\\n1 S ee O.

Instead of the countryman\\'s\\nunchanging landscape, dominated by the regular alternation of\\nthe seasons, and the established hierarchy of social and moral\\norder symbolised by the manor-house, the parish church and the\\nvillage green, the citizen of eighteenthcentury London had a\\nhorizon that was in many ways like that of modern urban man.\\nThe streets and places of resort in the various quarters of the\\ntown presented an infinite variety of ways of life, ways of life\\nthat anyone could observe, and yet for the most part utterly\\nalien to any one individual\\'s personal experience.\\nThis combination of physical proximity and vast social distance is\\na typical feature of urbanisation, and one of its results is to give\\na particular emphasis to external and material values in the citydweller\\'s\\nattitude to life: the most conspicuous values -- those\\nwhich are common to the visual experience of everyone -- are\\neconomic; in eighteenth-century London, for example, it was the\\ncoaches, fine houses and expensive clothes which pervade the\\noutlook of Moll Flanders. There was no real metropolitan\\nequivalent to the expression of the community values available\\nto all represented by the parish church in the country. In many\\nof the new centres of population there was no church at all, and,\\nconsequently, according to Swift, \\'five parts in six of the people\\nof London [were] absolutely hindered from hearing divine\\nservice\\'; 2 and in any case the atmosphere of what was fast\\nbecoming \\'a mart of infidelity\\' 3 tended to discourage churchgoing\\n-- Bishop Secker said that \\'people of fashion\\' often\\nattended \\'Divine worship in the country... to avoid scandal\\',\\n____________________\\nJournal of Sociology, XLIV ( 1938), 1-24, and Lewis Mumford\\nimaginative and historical treatment in The Culture of Cities (\\n181\\n1938).

Both these subjects also feature\\nprominently in eighteenthcentury literature, where the novel\\nsupplemented the work of journalists and pamphleteers 3 and\\nrevealed all the secrets of the town: both Defoe and Richardson\\nappeal to this interest, and it is even more marked in such works\\nas Fielding Amelia and Smollett Humphrey Clinker. At the same\\ntime London figured in much of the drama and fiction of the time\\nas the symbol of wealth, luxury, excitement and perhaps a rich\\nhusband: for Steele\\'s novel-reading girl Biddy Tipkins, and for\\nEliza Haywood\\'s Betsy Thoughtless it is the milieu where\\neverything happens, where people really live: triumph in the big\\ncity has become the Holy Grail in the individual\\'s secular\\npilgrimage.\\nFew participated in the glories and miseries of London life more\\nintensely than Defoe. London born and bred, he ran the gamut of\\n182\\ncourt and jail, and finally, like the Complete Tradesman he\\nwanted to be and in a sense was, finished life with coach and\\ncountry-house. He was intensely interested in all London\\'s\\nproblems, as is evident in such studies as Augusta Triumphans\\n____________________\\n1 C it. W. E.

His heroes and heroines make their way through\\nthe competitive and immoral metropolitan jungle in the pursuit of\\nfortune, and as we accompany them we are given a very\\ncomplete picture of many of the London milieus, from the\\nCustoms House to Newgate Prison, from the poor tenements of\\nRatcliff to the fashionable parks and houses of the West End. Yet\\nalthough the picture has its selfish and sordid aspects, it has one\\nvery significant difference from that presented by the modern\\ncity. Defoe\\'s London is still a community, a community composed\\nby now of an almost infinite variety of parts, but at least of parts\\nwhich still recognise their kinship; it is large, but somehow\\nremains local, and Defoe and his characters are a part of it,\\nunderstanding and understood.\\nThere are probably many reasons for Defoe\\'s buoyant and secure\\ntone. He had some memory of the days before the Great Fire,\\nand the London he had grown up in was still an entity, much of it\\nenclosed by the City Wall. But the major reason is surely that\\nalthough Defoe had since seen enormous changes, he himself\\nhad participated in them actively and enthusiastically; he lived in\\nthe hurly-burly where the foundations of the new way of life\\nwere being laid: and he was at one with it.\\nRichardson\\'s picture of London is totally different. His works\\n183\\nexpress, not the life of the whole community, but a deep\\npersonal distrust and even fear of the urban environment.\\nEspecially in Clarissa: its heroine, like Pamela, is not one of the\\n\\'townwomen\\' whose \\'confident\\' mien Richardson so disliked, but\\na pure country girl; and her fall is caused by the fact that, as she\\nlater tells Belford, \\'I knew nothing of the town and its ways\\'. It is\\nthis which prevents Clarissa from realising that Mrs. Sinclair is \\'a\\nvery vile creature\\'; and although she notices that the tea which\\nis being used to drug her \\'has an odd taste\\' she is easily put off\\nwith the explanation that it contains \\' London milk\\'. When she\\nattempts to escape from her enemies she is equally at a\\ndisadvantage, never knowing what duplicities are hidden in the\\nbehaviour of the people she meets, or what\\n-181-\\nhorrors are being perpetrated behind the walls of its houses.\\nEventually she must die, because the pure heart cannot survive\\nthe immoral brutality of the \\'great wicked town\\'; 1 I but not until\\nshe has dragged herself through all her Stations of the Cross,\\nfrom St. Albans to the brothel off fashionable Dover Street, from\\nthe shady resorts of Hampstead to the sponging-house in High\\nHolborn, to find peace only when she returns to her native\\ncountryside for burial.\\nIt is interesting to note that one at least of Richardson\\'s\\ncontemporaries, the anonymous author of the 1754 Critical\\nRemarks on Sir Charles Grandison, Clarissa and Pamela, saw the\\nagents of Clarissa\\'s downfall as typical products of urbanisation.\\nHe wrote that \\'such characters as Lovelace and his associates, or\\nmother Sinclair and her nymphs\\' could only subsist \\'in a city like\\nLondon, the overgrown metropolis of a powerful empire, and an\\nextensive commerce\\', and added: \\'all these corruptions are the\\nnecessary and unavoidable consequence of such a constitution of\\nthings\\'. 2\\nThere can be little doubt that some of the differences between\\nthe attitudes of Defoe and Richardson to urban life are due to the\\nconsiderable changes that occurred in the middle decades of the\\ncentury. This period witnessed many innovations such as the\\nreplacement of signs by house numbers, the demolition of the\\ncity wall, the creation of central authorities for paving and\\nlighting the streets, water and sewerage, the reform of the police\\nsystem by Fielding; they are not particularly important in\\nthemselves, but they show that conditions demanded quite\\ndifferent methods from those which had formerly sufficed: 3\\nchanges of scale had reached a point which made changes of\\n184\\nsocial organisation imperative. Nevertheless, the great contrast\\nbetween Defoe and Richardson as Londoners cannot be explained\\nonly, or even mainly, as the result of the effects of increasing\\nurbanisation: the two men were, after all, only a generation\\napart-Defoe was born in 1660, Richardson in 1689. The major\\nreason for their very different portrayal of urban life is\\nundoubtedly that they were poles apart in physical and\\npsychological constitution.\\n____________________\\n1 C larissa, I, 353, III, 505, 368, I, 422; see also III, 68, 428.\\n2 P . 54.\\n3 S ee Ambrose Heal, \"The Numbering of Houses in London\\nStreets\", N. & Q., CLXXXIII ( 1942), 100-101; Sir Walter\\nBesant, London in the Eighteenth Century ( London, 1925), 84-\\n85, 88-101, 125-132; George, London Life, pp. 99-103.\\n-182-\\nEven here, however, their differences have a certain\\nrepresentative quality. Defoe had all the vigour of the textile\\ntradesmen pictured by Deloney over a century earlier; like them\\nhe was in part a countryman, knowledgeable about crops and\\ncattle, as much at home riding up and down the country as in\\nshop or the counting-house; even in London the \\'Change, the\\ncoffee-house and the streets supply him with the equivalent of\\nthe watching countryside of saga: and wherever he goes he is at\\nhome. But if Defoe harks back to the days of the heroic\\nindependence of the citizenry, Richardson offers us a glimpse of\\nthe middle-class tradesman to come, bounded by the horizons of\\nthe office in the city and the gentility of the suburban home.\\nLondon itself certainly provides no way of life in which he can\\nparticipate. On the one hand, he is deeply aware of the social\\ndifferences between the tradesmen of the City and the people of\\nquality who inhabit Westminster, and this awareness is not\\nqualified by Defoe\\'s confident preference for his own class.\\n\\'There is a bar between us\\', Richardson wrote to Mrs. Delany in\\n1753 concerning a mutual acquaintance,\\'TempleBar. Ladies who\\nlive near Hill Street, and Berkeley and Grosvenor Squares, love\\nnot to pass this bar. They speak of it, as if it were a day\\'s\\njourney.\\' On the other hand, Richardson participated very little in\\nthe life of his own environment. He was \\'not able to bear a\\ncrowd\\', and stopped going to church on that account; while even\\nin his own printing-shop he preferred to supervise his own\\nworkmen by looking through \\'a spy window\\'. 1 As for the\\npleasures of the town, they were the road to damnation of such\\nabandoned females as Sally Martin in Clarissa, and made him\\n185\\nlong for \\'the last age, when there were no Vauxhalls, Ranelaghs,\\nMarybones, and such-like places of diversion, to dress out for\\nand gad after\\'. 2 Even the life of the streets was rapidly\\nbecoming something which only the poor shared. Certainly not\\nRichardson if we can judge from the description he gave Lady\\nBradshaigh of how he walked abroad:\\nOne hand generally in his bosom, the other a cane in it, which he\\nleans upon under the skirts of his coat usually, that it may\\nimperceptibly serve him as a support, when attacked by sudden\\ntremors or startings, and dizziness, which too frequently attack\\nhim. . . .

Cheyne suggested\\nthat Richardson, whose nerves did not allow him to ride horseback,\\nshould at least get a \\'chamber-horse\\', a \\'liver-shaking device\\', as B.\\nW.

But exercise\\ncould not allay the fever of his nerves, and here Cheyne diagnosed\\nthe \\'English Malady\\' or \\'nervous hyp,\\', which was no more, he\\nconfessed, than \\'a short expression for any kind of nervous\\ndisorder\\', 3 and which may be regarded as the eighteenth-century\\nversion of anxiety neurosis, the typical derangement of the urban\\nPsyche.\\nRichardson, then, is an example of many of the less salutary effects\\nof urbanisation, and here the contrast with his great contemporary\\nFielding is as great as that with Defoe. It also had equally marked\\nliterary consequences, as was pointed out by Richardson\\'s\\nacquaintance Mrs. Donnellan, who linked his poor health with his\\ncharacteristic sensibility as a writer, in an attempt to console\\nRichardson for his perpetual ill-health:\\n. . . the misfortune is, those who are fit to write delicately, must\\nthink so; those who can form a distress must be able to feel it; and\\nas the mind and the body are so united as to influence one another,\\n186\\nthe delicacy is communicated, and one too often finds softness and\\ntenderness of mind in a body equally remarkable for those qualities.\\nTom Jones could get drunk, and do all sorts of bad things in the\\nheight of his joy for his uncle\\'s recovery.

Briefly he suggests that economic\\nchanges and Protestantism combined to destroy man\\'s sense of\\nharmony with the natural life and with his fellows, and as a result\\ncreated \\'the feeling of individualism and personality, which is\\nexistence in isolation\\'. This harmony had existed \\'in the old\\nEngland\\' until the middle of the eighteenth century: \\'we feel it\\',\\nLawrence wrote, \\'in Defoe or Fielding.

Already this old maid typifies\\n\"personality\" instead of character, the sharp knowing in\\napartness.\\' 1\\nLawrence, of course, was a refugee from \\'personality\\' and\\npersonal relationships, from a world of \\'nothing but people\\'. 2 By\\nbeing so, he was, perhaps, a refugee from the novel. For the\\nworld of the novel is essentially the world of the modern city;\\nboth present a picture of life in which the individual is immersed\\nin private and personal relationships because a larger\\ncommunion with nature or society is no longer available; and it is\\nsurely Richardson, rather than his successor Jane Austen, who is\\nthe first novelist in whom all the tendencies which make for a\\n\\'sharp knowing in apartness\\' are apparent.\\nThe connection between urbanisation and the novel\\'s\\n187\\nconcentration on personal relationships is stated in E.

By the middle of the century,\\nhowever, there are signs that a different attitude was coming\\ninto being. London, for example, is the milieu where, as the\\nsubtitle of her novel David Simple ( 1744) announces, Sarah\\nFielding\\'s hero travels cheerlessly \\'Through London and\\nWestminster in Search of a Real Friend\\', lonely and anonymous\\nin an anarchic environment where personal contacts are\\nmercenary, fleeting and faithless.\\nRichardson\\'s recoil from this environment would seem to have\\nbeen very similar. Fortunately, however, there was a way out:\\nurbanisation provided its own antidote, the suburb, which offered\\nan escape from the thronged streets, and whose very different\\nmode of life symbolised the difference between the multifarious\\nbut casual relationships depicted in Defoe\\'s novels and the fewer\\nbut more intense and introverted ones which Richardson\\nportrayed.\\n188\\nDefoe had spent his last years at Stoke Newington, but the\\npattern of living in the suburbs even before retirement was still\\nrelatively new, as was pointed out in the introduction of the 1839\\nedition of the Complete English Tradesman, which comments\\ndisdainfully that from Defoe\\'s \\'insisting so much on the wives of\\ntradesmen acquainting themselves with their husbands\\'\\nbusiness, and his scarcely making any allusion to out-of-town\\nhouses for the families of tradesmen... we readily see that a\\nsimple state of things then existed in London, such as is now\\nperhaps found only in fourth-rate towns\\'. 1 Very soon, however,\\nthe movement of the prosperous into the suburb became very\\nmarked, and indeed caused a decline of the population within the\\nCity limits. 2 This was one urban trend in which Richardson could\\nunreservedly participate; on week-ends and holidays he was\\nhappy to leave his place of business in Salisbury Court off the\\nStrand to luxuriate in the peace of his handsome retreats first at\\n\\'agreeable suburbane North End\\', and after 1754 at Parson\\'s\\nGreen.

Both the very\\nrich and the very poor are excluded, and so the middle-class\\npattern can develop unmolested, safe both from the glittering\\nimmorality of the fashionable end of town and from the equally\\naffronting misery and shiftlessness of the poor -- the word \\'Mob\\'\\nis a significant late seventeenth-century coinage which reflects a\\ngrowing distaste and at times even fear of the urban masses.\\nThe contrast between the old urban way of life and the new\\nsocial pattern which replaced it is perhaps best suggested by the\\ndifferent implications of the words \\'urbane\\' and \\'suburban\\': the\\none is a Renaissance idea, the other typically Victorian. \\'Urbanity\\'\\ndenotes the qualities of politeness and understanding which are\\nthe product of the wider social experience which city life makes\\npossible; with it goes the spirit of comedy which, in Italian,\\n189\\nFrench or English comedy of the sixteenth and seventeenth\\ncenturies, centres on the gay life of the streets and the squares,\\nwhere the walls of houses afford a purely nominal privacy.\\n\\'Suburban\\', on the other hand, denotes the sheltered\\ncomplacence and provinciality of the sheltered middle-class\\nhome: as Mumford has said, the suburb is a \\'collective attempt\\nto live a private life\\'; 3 it offers a peculiar combination of the\\nsolace of society with the safety of personal privacy; it is\\ndedicated to an essentially feminine ideal of quiet domesticity\\nand selective personal relationships which could only be\\nportrayed in the novel, and which found its first full literary\\nexpression in the works of Richardson.\\nThe privacy of the suburb is essentially feminine because it\\nreflects the increasing tendency already discussed to regard the\\nmodesty of womanhood as highly vulnerable and therefore in\\nneed of a defensive seclusion; and the seclusion of the suburb\\nwas increased by two other developments of the period -- the\\ngreater privacy afforded by Georgian housing, and the new\\npattern of personal relationships made possible by familiar\\n____________________\\n1 A ccount, p. 36.\\n2 C it.

Then gradually the private bedroom and\\nseparate dining quarters for masters and servants became\\ncurrent; by the eighteenth century the final refinements of\\ndomestic privacy had fully established themselves. There was\\nmuch more emphasis than before on separate sleeping quarters\\nfor every member of the family, and even for the household\\nservants; a separate fireplace in all the main rooms, so that\\neveryone could be alone whenever they wished, became one of\\nthe details which the up-to-date housewife noted with\\napprobation; and locks on doors -- still a great rarity in the\\nsixteenth century -- became one of the modernisations on which\\nthe genteel insisted, as Pamela does when she and Mr. B. are\\npreparing a house for her parents. 1 Pamela, of course, has good\\nreason to pay attention to this matter: during her ordeals being\\n191\\nable to lock the door of her various sleeping places was a matter\\nof life or a fate worse than death.\\nAnother characteristic feature of the Georgian house is the\\ncloset, or small private apartment usually adjoining the bedroom.\\nTypically, it stores not china and preserves but books, a writing\\ndesk and a standish; it is an early version of the room of one\\'s\\nown which Virginia Woolf saw as the prime requisite of woman\\'s\\nemancipation; and it was much more characteristically the locus\\nof woman\\'s liberty and even licence than its French equivalent,\\nthe boudoir, for it was used, not to conceal gallants but to lock\\nthem out while Pamela writes her \\'saucy journal\\' and Clarissa\\nkeeps Anna Howe abreast of the news.\\nRichardson was something of a propagandist for this new\\nforcing-house of the feminine sensibility; in a letter to Miss\\nWestcomb, for example, he contrasts the \\'goose-like gabble\\' of\\nsocial conversation with the delights of epistolary intercourse for\\nthe lady who makes \\'her closet her paradise\\'. 2 His heroines do\\nnot and cannot share the life of the street, the highways and the\\nplaces of public resort with Defoe\\'s Moll Flanders and even\\nFielding\\'s Miss Western, whom Richardson described with\\ncharacteristically outraged horror as \\'inn-frequenting Sophia\\'; 3\\n____________________\\n1 P amela, Pt.

The basis of the cult was the\\ngreat increase in the leisure and literacy of middleclass women;\\nand it was materially assisted by a very great improvement of\\npostal facilities. A penny post was established in London in 1680,\\n191\\nand by the twenties of the next century it gave a service whose\\ncheapness, speed and efficiency were, according to Defoe at\\nleast, unrivalled throughout Europe; while the ensuing decades\\nalso witnessed a great improvement in the postal system of the\\nrest of the country. 1\\nWith the increase in the writing of letters went a significant\\nchange in their nature. In the sixteenth century and earlier most\\nregular correspondences were of a public nature, concerned with\\ncommercial, political or diplomatic affairs. Letters were of course\\nwritten about other matters, about literature, family concerns\\nand indeed love: but they seem to have been fairly rare and\\nconfined to a relatively restricted social circle. There is certainly\\nlittle indication of the existence of the \\'scribbling treaties\\', as\\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu called them, 2 that were so common\\nin the eighteenth century -- correspondences in which people of\\nvery varying social classes habitually exchanged news and\\nopinions about their ordinary lives. A fairly recent parallel to the\\nkind of change that seems to have occurred is afforded by the\\ntelephone: long reserved for important transactions, usually of a\\nbusiness nature, its use, as facilities improved and cheapened,\\nwas gradually extended, especially under feminine influence\\nperhaps, to the purposes of ordinary sociability and even\\nintimate converse.\\nAt all events, by 1740 it was apparently not wholly implausible\\nthat a servant-girl such as Pamela should keep regularly in\\n____________________\\n1 H oward Robinson, The British Post Office: A History (\\nPrinceton, 1948), pp. 70103.\\n2 L etters and Works, I, 24.\\n-189-\\ntouch with her parents; and it was, of course, the wide diffusion\\nof the letter-writing habit which provided Richardson with the\\ninitial impetus to write her adventures, since it led two of his\\nbookselling associates to suggest that he prepare a volume of\\n\\'Familiar Letters\\' \\'in a common style, on such subjects as might\\nbe of use to those Country Readers, who were unable to indite\\nfor themselves\\'. 1\\nPamela\\'s epistolary expertness, however, suggests a somewhat\\nhigher-class position than the one which she is supposed to have\\n-- she patently needs no help in inditing! She is, in fact, a\\nheroine after the pattern of those innumerable eighteenth192\\ncentury gentlewomen who took Richardson\\'s own advice as to\\nthe employment of their leisure: \\'The pen is almost as pretty an\\nimplement in a woman\\'s fingers, as a needle\\'. 2\\nWe are now in a position to see more clearly the main links\\nbetween urbanisation and Richardson\\'s emphasis on private\\nexperience. The same causes which brought about Richardson\\'s\\nrejection of city life and his preference for the suburb, made him\\nfind his supreme satisfaction in familiar letter-writing, the form of\\npersonal intercourse most suited to the way of life which the\\nsuburb represents. Only in such a relationship could Richardson\\ncircumvent the deep inhibitions which made him silent and ill at\\nease in company, and caused him to prefer to communicate with\\nhis workmen in the printing-house, and even with his own family,\\nby means of \\'little notes\\'. 3 All these inhibitions could be\\nforgotten when he was engaged in real or fictitious\\ncorrespondences: it was a necessity of his being so deep that his\\nfriends said that \\'whenever Mr. Richardson thought himself sick,\\nit was because he had not a pen in his hand\\'. 4\\nThe pen alone offered him the possibility of satisfying his two\\ndeepest psychological needs, needs which were otherwise\\nmutually exclusive: withdrawal from society, and emotional\\nrelease. \\'The pen\\', he wrote, \\'is jealous of company. It expects,\\nas I may say, to engross the writer\\'s whole self; every body\\nallows the writer to withdraw.\\' At the same time the pen offered\\nan escape from solitude into an ideal kind of personal\\nrelationship. As he wrote to Miss Westcomb, \\'Correspondence is,\\nindeed, the cement of friendship; it is friendship avowed under\\nhand and\\n____________________\\n1 C orrespondence, I, liii.\\n2 I bid., VI, 120.\\n3 I bid., I, clxxxi.\\n4 C it.

More pure, and yet\\nmore ardent, and less broken in upon, than personal\\nconversation can ever be amongst the most pure, because of the\\ndeliberation it allows, from the preparation to, and action of\\nwriting.\\' 1 So insistent, indeed, was Richardson\\'s conviction that\\nepistolary converse gave him the emotional satisfaction which\\nordinary life denied, that he supported his belief with a\\nrevelatory, though erroneous, etymology: \\'familiar letter writing\\',\\n193\\nLovelace explains in Clarissa, \\'was writing from the heart... as\\nthe very word \"Cor-respondence\" implied\\', and adds \\'Not the\\nheart only; the soul was in it\\'. 2\\nII\\nThe literary advantages and disadvantages of the epistolary form\\nin fiction have been much discussed. 3 The disadvantages are\\nparticularly obvious -- the implausibility of such incessant\\nrecourse to the pen, and the repetition and prolixity which the\\nmethod imposes, often make us sympathise with Lovelace\\'s\\nimprecation, \\'Rot the goose and the goose quill!\\' 4 The major\\nadvantage, of course, is that letters are the most direct material\\nevidence for the inner life of their writers that exist. Even more\\nthan the memoir they are, to repeat Flaubert\\'s phrase, \\'le réel\\nécrit\\', and their reality is one which reveals the subjective and\\nprivate orientations of the writer both towards the recipient and\\nthe people discussed, as well as the writer\\'s own inner being. As\\nDr. Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale: \\'A man\\'s letters... are only the\\nmirror of his breast, whatever passes within him is shown\\nundisguised in its natural process. Nothing is inverted, nothing\\ndistorted, you see systems in their elements, you discover\\nactions in their motives\\'. 5\\nThe main problem in portraying the inner life is essentially one of\\nthe time-scale. The daily experience of the individual is\\ncomposed of a ceaseless flow of thought, feeling and sensation;\\nbut most literary forms -- biography and even autobiography for\\ninstance -- tend to be of too gross a temporal mesh to retain\\n____________________\\n1 C orrespondence, III, 247, 245.\\n2 C larissa, II, 431.\\n3 S ee G.

Yet it is this\\nminute-by-minute content of consciousness which constitutes\\nwhat the individual\\'s personality really is, and dictates his\\nrelationship to others: it is only by contact with this\\n194\\nconsciousness that a reader can participate fully in the life of a\\nfictional character.\\nThe nearest record of this consciousness in ordinary life is the\\nprivate letter, and Richardson was fully aware of the advantages\\nto be derived from his \\'writing to the minute\\' technique, as he\\ncalled it. He was most explicit about this advantage in the\\nPreface to Clarissa: \\'All the letters are written while the hearts of\\nthe writers must be supposed to be wholly engaged in their\\nsubjects... so that they abound, not only with critical situations,\\nbut with what may be called instantaneous descriptions and\\nreflections\\'. This present-tense recording of the action,\\nRichardson felt, also gave him a great advantage over the\\nautobiographical memoir which Defoe and Marivaux had used as\\nthe basis of their narrative technique. For, as a contemporary\\ncritic pointed out in a letter which Richardson reproduced in the\\nPostscript to Clarissa, \\'The minute particulars of events, the\\nsentiments and conversation of the parties\\' were in his method\\n\\'exhibited with all the warmth and spirit that the passion\\nsupposed to be predominant at the very time could produce\\'; on\\nthe other hand, \\'Romances in general, and Marivaux\\'s amongst\\nothers, are wholly improbable, because they suppose the history\\nto be written after the series of events is closed by the\\ncatastrophe; a circumstance which implies a strength of memory\\nbeyond all example and probability\\'. 1\\nThe argument of improbability is not a very convincing one; the\\nepistolary method is by no means exempt from it in other ways,\\nand both methods must be accepted for what they are, literary\\nconventions. But it is true that the use of the epistolary method\\nimpels the writer towards producing something that may pass for\\nthe spontaneous transcription of the subjective reactions of the\\nprotagonists to the events as they occur and thus to break even\\nmore completely than Defoe did with the more patently selective\\nand summarising tendency of classical writing. For, if events are\\nremembered long after the event, the\\n____________________\\n1 T he Everyman and many other editions do not reprint the\\nprefatory matter of the novels, nor the important Postscript of\\nClarissa. Quotations here are from the Shakespeare Head\\nEdition ( Oxford, 1930).\\n-192-\\nmemory performs a somewhat similar function, retaining only\\nwhat led to significant action and forgetting whatever was\\n195\\ntransitory and abortive.\\nRichardson\\'s attempt to achieve what in the \\'Preface by the\\nEditor\\' to Pamela he called \\'an immediate impression of every\\ncircumstance\\' obviously led to much that was trifling and\\nridiculous. This aspect of his narrative was nicely parodied by\\nShenstone: \\'So I sat down and wrote thus far: scrattle, scrattle,\\ngoes the pen -- why, how now? says I -- what\\'s the matter with\\nthe pen? So I thought I would make an end of the letter,\\nbecause my pen went scrattle, scrattle...\\' 1 Pamela\\'s repetitions\\nand her habit of conversing with herself over trivialities are fair\\nenough game; but even in Shenstone\\'s parody, especially when\\nread in its entirety, it is evident that this very garrulity itself\\nbrings us extremely close to Pamela\\'s inner consciousness; it is\\nnecessary that the train of thought should often be ephemeral\\nand transparent in this way, so that we can feel sure that\\nnothing is being withheld. The very lack of selectiveness, indeed,\\nimpels us to a more active involvement in the events and\\nfeelings described: we have to pick significant items of character\\nand behaviour out of a wealth of circumambient detail, much as\\nin real life we attempt to gather meaning from the casual flux of\\ncircumstance. This is the kind of participation which the novel\\ntypically induces: it makes us feel that we are in contact not with\\nliterature but with the raw materials of life itself as they are\\nmomentarily reflected in the minds of the protagonists.\\nPrevious traditions of letter-writing would not have encouraged\\nthis narrative direction. John Lyly\\'s Euphues ( 1579), for\\nexample, is also an exemplary tale told in letters: but, in keeping\\nboth with the literary and the epistolary traditions of his time,\\nLyly\\'s emphasis was on producing new models of eloquence; the\\ncharacters and their actions are of very secondary importance.\\nBut by the time of Pamela the majority of the literate public\\ncared little for the traditions of courtly rhetoric, and used letters\\nonly for the purpose of sharing their daily thoughts and acts with\\na friend; the cult of familiar letter-writing, in fact, provided\\nRichardson with a microphone already attuned to the tones of\\nprivate experience.\\nThe fact that Richardson was using an essentially feminine, and\\nfrom a literary point of view, amateur, tradition of letter-\\n____________________\\n1 L etters, ed. Mallam, p. 24.\\n-193-\\n196\\nwriting, also helped him to break with the traditional decorums of\\nprose and use a style that was wholly suited to embody the kind\\nof mental process with which his narrative was concerned. In\\nthis, as in many other things, he was a good deal more conscious\\nand even sophisticated about his literary purpose than he\\nsometimes allowed; there is at least a strong suggestion in\\nClarissa that he regarded his own literary style as infinitely\\nsuperior to those of the classically educated for his particular\\npurposes: Anna Howe tells us that \\'mere scholars\\' too often\\n\\'spangle over their productions with metaphors; they rumble into\\nbombast: the sublime with them, lying in words and not in\\nsentiment\\'; while others \\'sinking into the classical pits, there\\npoke and scramble about, never seeking to show genius of their\\nown\\'. 1\\nOn the other hand, the familiar letters both of Richardson and his\\nless educated feminine correspondents were simpler and less\\nconscious: everything was subordinated to the aim of expressing\\nthe ideas passing in the mind at the moment of writing. This can\\nbe seen in Richardson\\'s real letters as well as his fictional ones:\\nin this passage to Lady Bradshaigh, for example:\\nAnother there was whom his soul loved; but with a reverence -\\nHush! Pen, lie thee down! --\\nA timely Check; where, else, might I have ended? This ladyhow\\nhard to forbear the affecting subject! But I will forbear. This man\\npresumed not -- Again going on! not a word more this night. 2\\nThere is a complete break here with the mode of Augustan\\nprose, but it is an essential condition for Richardson\\'s success in\\ntranscribing the inner drama of impulse and inhibition.\\nIn the novels Richardson\\'s use of language is concentrated on\\nproducing what his characters might plausibly write in the\\ncircumstances. One expression of this is Richardson\\'s use of\\npopular words and phrases. In Pamela, for example, we get such\\ncolloquialisms as \\'fat-face\\', \\'no better than he should be\\', and\\n\\'you might have beat me down with a feather\\' 3 -- neither\\nelegant nor pungent enough to have been used in comedy or\\nsatire, yet redolent of the moral and social milieu of the book.\\nBut Richardson\\'s most characteristic linguistic innovation was in\\nvocabulary, and here, too, his aim was to create a literary\\nvehicle for the more exact transcription of psychological\\nprocesses. One anonymous pamphleteer, for instance,\\ncomplained about\\n197\\n____________________\\n1 C larissa, IV, 495.\\n2 C orrespondence, I, clx.\\nI, 356, 6, 8.\\n-194-\\nRichardson\\'s \\'many new-coined words and phrases, Grandison\\'s\\nmeditatingly, Uncle Selby\\'s scrupulosities, and a vast variety of\\nothers\\' which, he feared, might \\'by the laborious industry of\\nsome future compiler\\' be \\'transferred into a Dictionary\\'. 1 As it\\nhappens, these particular words had been used before although\\nRichardson may well have coined them independently. In any\\ncase, they both indicate Richardson\\'s characteristic literary\\ndirection: \\'meditatingly\\' shows the need for the accurate\\ntranscription of the feeling-tones of the characters; while\\n\\'scrupulosities\\' is a useful piece of shorthand to denote all the\\nrestraints great and small which dominate the inner world of his\\ncharacters.\\nLord Chesterfield, interestingly enough, seems to have been\\naware of the connection between Richardson\\'s breach with\\nlinguistic decorum and the fact that his eye was on a new literary\\nobject. He connected Richardson\\'s uneducated \\'small talk\\' with\\nhis \\'great knowledge and skill both in painting and in interesting\\nthe heart\\', and conceded that Richardson had \\'even coined some\\nexpressions for those little secret movements that are\\nadmirable\\'. 2 He did not, unfortunately, specify what words he\\nhad in mind, but three of Richardson\\'s actual coinages may be\\ncited which offer some support for his view: \\'Childbed matronises\\nthe giddiest spirits\\' 3 is evidence of the need to pin down a whole\\ncomplex psychological development in a single word; Clarissa\\noffers us the first recorded usage of the word personalities\\'\\nmeaning \\'individual traits\\', long before its modern usage in the\\nsingular was established; while Grandison provides us with\\n\\'femalities\\' which is indeed \\'a peculiar but expressive word of Mr.\\nSelby\\'s\\'. 4\\nThe letter form, then, offered Richardson a short-cut, as it were,\\nto the heart, and encouraged him to express what he found\\nthere with the greatest possible precision, even at the cost of\\nshocking the literary traditionalists. As a result, his readers found\\nin his novels the same complete engrossment of their inner\\nfeelings, and the same welcome withdrawal into an imaginary\\n____________________\\n1 C ritical Remarks on Sir Charles Grandison, Clarissa and\\n198\\nPamela...

It is also the only possible mode of\\ncommunication for modern urban culture. Aristotle thought that\\nthe proper size of the city should be limited by the need for the\\ncitizens to conduct their affairs in one meetingplace; 1 beyond\\nthis size the culture ceases to be oral, and writing becomes the\\nmain means of intercommunication; and with the later invention\\nof printing there comes into being that typical feature of modern\\nurbanisation which Lewis Mumford has called \\'the pseudoenvironment\\nof paper\\' whereby \\'what is visible and real... is only\\nwhat has been transferred to paper\\'. 2\\nThe literary importance of the new medium is difficult to analyse.\\nBut it is at least clear that all the major literary forms were\\noriginally oral, and that this continued to affect their aims and\\nconventions long after the advent of print. In the Elizabethan\\nperiod, for instance, not only poetry but even prose were still\\ncomposed primarily with a view to performance by the human\\nvoice. That literature was eventually to be printed was a minor\\nmatter, compared to pleasing patrons whose taste was formed\\non the old oral models. It was not until the rise of journalism that\\na new form of writing arose which was wholly dependent on\\nprinted performance, and the novel is perhaps the only literary\\ngenre which is essentially connected with the medium of print: it\\nis therefore very appropriate that our first novelist should have\\n199\\nbeen a printer himself.\\nRichardson\\'s reliance on his trade for some of his characteristic\\nliterary effects has been noted by F. H. Wilcox: \\'the very\\ntypographical form of Richardson\\'s writings\\', he points out,\\n\\'bears witness to his passion for fidelity to the actual fact. No\\nEnglish writer has understood so well the literary possibilities\\n____________________\\n1 P olitics, Bk. VII, ch. 4, sects. ii-xiv.\\n2 C ulture of Cities, pp. 355-357.\\n-196-\\nof punctuation marks... for inflections and rhythms of actual\\nconversation.\\' 1 Richardson\\'s freedom with italics, large letters,\\nand the dash to indicate an incomplete sentence, certainly help\\nto convey the impression of a literal transcript of reality,\\nalthough they must surely have been regarded by many of his\\ncontemporaries as merely the result of an imperfect command of\\nthe normal resources of literary style. Their view, indeed,\\nperhaps finds some justification in two very obtrusive\\ntypographical devices in Clarissa: the heroine\\'s disjointed\\noutbursts in her delirium are expressed in a jumble of poetical\\nfragments printed at varying angles on the page in imitation of\\nher original demented doodlings on \\'Paper X\\'; and Lovelace\\'s\\nfinal cry \\'LET THIS EXPIATE\\' is rendered in extra large capitals. 2\\nRichardson, however, exploited the resources of his medium in\\nother and much more important ways. Print, as a mode of\\nliterary communication, has two characteristics which derive\\nfrom its total impersonality: they may be called the authority and\\nthe illusion of print, and they give the novelist a tremendous\\nflexibility of narrative approach, since they enable him to\\nmodulate effortlessly from the public to the private voice, from\\nthe realities of the Stock Exchange to those of the daydream.\\nThe authority of print -- the impression that all that is printed is\\nnecessarily true -- was established very early. If Autolycus\\'s\\nballads were in print, Mopsa was \\'sure they are true\\'. 3 The\\ninnkeeper in Don Quixote has the same conviction about\\nromances. 4 Print, to the reader, is no fallible specimen of\\nhumanity -- no actor, bard or speaker who must prove himself\\nworthy of credence: it is a material reality which can be seen by\\nall the world and will outlive everyone in it. Nothing printed has\\nany of the individuality, the margin of error, the assertion of\\npersonal idiosyncrasy, which even the best manuscript retains; it\\n211\\nis more like an impersonal fiat which -- partly because the State\\nand the Church print their messages, and so hallow the medium\\n-- has received the stamp of universal social approbation. We do\\nnot, instinctively at least and until experience has made us wise,\\nquestion what has appeared in print.\\nDefoe, obviously, made great use of this authority of print: his\\nstories tend towards the purely impersonal, historic narration\\n____________________\\n1 \" Prévost\\'s Translations of Richardson\\'s Novels\", Univ. California\\nPubs. in Modern Philolog, XII ( 1927), p. 389.\\n2 C larissa, III, 209; IV, 530.\\n3 T he Winter\\'s Tale, Act IV, sc. iv.\\nPart I, ch. 32.\\n-197-\\nof events which is the method of journalism and reportage. It is\\nof the essence of the newspaper that it pretends to be\\nimpersonal, to prevent the reader from asking \\'Who made this\\nup?\\'\\nThe impersonal authority of print is complemented by its\\ncapacity for securing a complete penetration of the reader\\'s\\nsubjective life. The mechanically produced and therefore identical\\nletters set with absolute uniformity on the page are, of course,\\nmuch more impersonal than any manuscript, but at the same\\ntime they can be read much more autohaatically: ceasing to be\\nconscious of the printed page before our eyes we surrender\\nourselves entirely to the world of illusion which the printed novel\\ndescribes. This effect is heightened by the fact that we are\\nusually alone when we read, and that the book, for the time\\nbeing, becomes a kind of extension of our personal life -- a\\nprivate possession that we keep with us in our pocket or under\\nthe pillow, and that tells of an intimate world of which no one\\nspeaks out loud in ordinary life, a world which had previously\\nfound utterance only in the diary, the confession or the familiar\\nletter, forms of expression exclusively addressed to one person,\\nwhether the writer himself, the priest or the close friend.\\nThe private nature of the novel\\'s mode of performance was a\\nnecessity both for the author and for the reader of Pamela or\\nClarissa. It is probable that, for psychological reasons,\\nRichardson, as he himself said, could only have become an\\nauthor with \\'the umbrage of the editor\\'s character to screen\\n[himself] behind\\' 1 while as for the reader, it is a matter of\\n211\\ncommon observation that the reactions of a group tend to be\\nquite different from the reactions which the same individuals\\nwould make when alone. Richardson was quite aware of this.\\nWhen the Rev. Dr. Lewen urges that Clarissa bring Lovelace to\\npublic trial for the rape she answers, quite realistically: \\'Little\\nadvantage in a court... would some of those pleas in my favour\\nhave been, which out of court, and to a private and serious\\naudience, would have carried the greatest weight against him\\'. A\\nbare summary of the events might suggest that Clarissa courted\\nher fate; only a full knowledge of her sentiments and aspirations,\\nand the certainty that Lovelace understood them well enough to\\nrealise the enormity of his offence, enable us to understand the\\nreal nature of the story. This is further exemplified in the\\nbrilliantly executed scene at the ball given by Colonel Ambrose\\n____________________\\n1 C orrespondence, I, lxxvi\\n-198-\\nwhere Lovelace secures acceptance from a social group of which\\nmany members are friends of Clarissa\\'s and know of his\\nbehaviour towards her: even Anna Howe is unable in public to\\nmake the effective protest that her feelings demand. 1\\nBut the supreme reason for Richardson\\'s dependence on the\\nnovel\\'s mode of performance is, of course, his concern with that\\nmost private aspect of experience, the sexual life. The stage, in\\nWestern Europe at least, has never been able to go very far in\\nthe description of sexual behaviour, whereas in his novels\\nRichardson was able to present much that in any other form\\nwould have been quite unacceptable to an audience whose public\\ndemeanour, at least, was very severely controlled by the\\nintensified taboos of a Puritan morality.\\nClarissa is an extreme example of this. Richardson\\'s impersonal\\nand anonymous role allowed him to project his own secret\\nfantasies into a mysterious next room: and the privacy and\\nanonymity of print placed the reader behind a keyhole where he,\\ntoo, could peep in unobserved and witness rape being prepared,\\nattempted and eventually carried, out. Neither the reader nor the\\nauthor were violating any decorum: they were in exactly the\\nsame situation as Mandeville\\'s virtuous young woman who\\nexemplified the curious duality of public and private attitudes to\\nsex. Her modesty in public was easily ruffled, but \\'let them talk\\nas much bawdy as they please in the room next to the same\\nvirtuous young woman, where she is sure that she is\\n212\\nundiscovered, and she will hear, if not hearken to it, without\\nblushing at all\\'. 2 Ironically enough, Richardsonhimself seems to\\nhave used a similar argument to defend himself against those\\nwho had censured the \\'warm\\' scenes in Clarissa as exceeding\\n\\'the bounds of decency\\'. He either wrote himself, or inspired Mr.\\nUrban to write, in the Gentleman\\'s Magazine that \\' a nice person\\nof the sex may not... be able to bear those scenes in action, and\\non the stage, in presence of a thousand witnesses, which she\\nmay not think objectible in her closet\\'. 3\\nThe printing-press, then, provided a literary medium much less\\nsensitive to the censorship of public attitudes than the stage, and\\none intrinsically better suited to the communication of private\\nfeelings and fantasies. One result of this was very apparent\\n____________________\\n1 C larissa, IV, 184, 19-26.\\n2 \" Remark C\", Fable of the Bees, I, 66.\\n3 C it. Dobson, Richardswi, pp. 100-101.\\n-199-\\nin the later development of the novel. After Richardson, many\\nauthors, publishers and circulating-library operators began to\\nengage in the mass production of fiction which merely provided\\nopportunities for daydreaming. Such, at least, was the opinion of\\nColeridge, in a memorable passage of Biographia Literaria:\\nAs to the devotees of the circulating libraries, I dare not\\ncompliment their pass-time or rather kill-time with the name of\\nreading. Call it rather a sort of beggarly day-dreaming, during\\nwhich the mind of the dreamer furnishes for itself nothing but\\nlaziness and a little mawkish sensibility. While the whole materiel\\nand imagery of the dose is supplied ab extra by a sort of camera\\nobscura manufactured at the printing office, which, pro tempore\\nfixes, reflects, and transmits the moving phantasms of one man\\'s\\ndelirium, so as to people the barrenness of a hundred other\\nbrains afflicted with the same trance or suspension of all\\ncommon sense and all definite purpose. . . . 1\\nIt would be un ust to Richardson, however, to suggest that the\\nmain advantage which he derived from the private circuit which\\nprint offered between himself and his readers was to present\\nthem with the content of his own daydreams, much less make\\npossible the description of actions which could not be presented\\npublicly owing to censorship. For although much has been said\\nabout Richardson\\'s \\'keyhole view of life\\', which he undoubtedly\\n213\\nused on occasion for unwholesome ends, it is also the essential\\nbasis of his remarkable opening up of the new domain of private\\nexperience for literary exploration. We must, after all, remember\\nthat the term itself is merely the pejorative form of the metaphor\\nby which another great and dedicated student of the inner life,\\nHenry James, expressed his belief in the necessity for the\\nauthor\\'s objectivity and detachment: for him the role of the\\nnovelist in the house of fiction is, if not that of the peeper\\nthrough keyholes, at least that of \\'the watcher at the window\\'. 2\\nIV\\nMany social and technical changes, then, combined to assist\\nRichardson in giving a fuller and more convincing presentation of\\nthe inner lives of his characters and of the complexities of\\n____________________\\n1 E d.

For\\nobvious reasons: we identify ourselves not with actions and\\nsituations but with the actors in them, and there had never\\nbefore been such opportunities for unreserved participation in\\nthe inner lives of fictional characters as were offered by\\nRichardson\\'s presentation of the flow of consciousness of Pamela\\nand Clarissa in their letters.\\nThe contemporary reception of Richardson\\'s novels shows this\\nvery clearly. Aaron Hill, for example, in a letter which Richardson\\nreproduced in the prefatory matter to Pamela, described how he\\nwas transformed into all the characters in turn as he read: \\'Now\\nand then, I am Colbrand the Swiss; but, as broad as I stride, in\\nthat Character, I can never escape Mrs. Jewkes: who often keeps\\nme awake in the Night\\'; 1 while Edward Young considered\\nClarissa \\'his last amour\\'. 2 The testimony of Diderot shows that in\\nFrance also Richardson\\'s characters were felt to be completely\\nreal persons. In his éloge de Richardson ( 1761) he relates how,\\nwhen reading Clarissa, he would cry out involuntarily to the\\nheroine: \\'Don\\'t believe him! He\\'s deceiving you! If you go you\\'ll\\nbe ruined!\\' As his reading drew to a close he \\'felt the same\\nsensations that people feel when they are about to part with\\n214\\nclose friends with whom they have lived for many years\\', and\\nwhen he had finished he \\'suddenly felt that he had been left\\nalone\\'. The experience, indeed, had been so exhausting that\\nwhen his friends saw him afterwards they wondered if he had\\nbeen ill, and asked if he\\'d lost a friend, or a parent. 3\\nTo some extent, of course, identification is a necessity of all\\nliterature, as it is of life. Man is a \\'role-taking animal\\'; he\\nbecomes a human being and develops his personality as the\\nresult of innumerable outgoings of himself into the thoughts and\\nfeelings of others; 4 and all literature obviously depends upon\\nthis human capacity for projection into other people and their\\nsituations. Aristotle\\'s theory of catharsis, for instance, presumes\\nthat the audience identifies itself to some extent with the tragic\\n____________________\\n1 P amela, 2nd ed., 1741, I, xxx.\\n2 R ichardson, Correspondence, II, 18.\\n3 OE uvres, ed.

The circumstance\\nof public theatrical performance, the nobility of the hero and the\\nexceptional horror of his fate, all reminded members of the\\naudience that what they were seeing was not life but art, and an\\nart that was depicting people and situations very different from\\nthose offered by their own daily experience.\\nThe novel, on the other hand, was inherently devoid of the\\nelements which restricted identification, and this more absolute\\npower over the reader\\'s consciousness does much to account for\\nthe peculiar triumphs and degradations of the novel form in\\ngeneral. On the one hand it is capable of the unrivalled subtlety\\nin the exploration of personality and personal relationships which\\nis found in the work of the greatest novelists; \\'the vast\\nimportance of the novel\\' for D. H. Lawrence is that it can \\'inform\\nand lead into new places the flow of our sympathetic\\nconsciousness... lead our sympathy away in recoil from things\\ngone dead... reveal the most secret places of life\\'. 1 On the other\\n215\\nhand, it is the same power over the consciousness which, far\\nfrom extending psychological and moral awareness, makes\\npossible the novel\\'s role as a popular purveyor of vicarious\\nsexual experience and adolescent wish-fulfilment.\\nRichardson has a unique place in the tradition of the novel\\nbecause he initiates both these directions. Every discovery is rich\\nin irony, because it is susceptible to such varied uses, but there\\nis a particularly complete irony in the divergent uses to which\\nRichardson put his literary discovery in his first work: for Pamela\\nis both a very remarkable psychological study and an\\nexploitation, as Cheyne wrote to Richardson, of what St. Paul\\n\\'like a polite man as well as a deep Christian\\' had forbidden when\\nhe wrote \\'It is a shame for you to speak of those things that are\\ndone by you in secret\\'. 2\\nCheyne was hinting at Fielding\\'s most extreme accusation in\\nShamela -- the view that Pamela\\'s popularity was due to the fact\\nthat it provided vicarious sexual stimulation. It is interesting to\\nnote that this charge is made in an introductory letter by Thomas\\nTickletext which is a close parody of Aaron Hill\\'s\\n____________________\\n1 L ady Chatterley\\'s Lover, ch. 9.\\n2 L etters to Richardson, pp. 68-69.\\n-202-\\neulogy of Richardson\\'s power to bring about a complete\\nidentification with his characters. Tickletext writes: \\'. . . if I lay\\nthe book down it comes after me. When it has dwelt all day long\\nupon the ear, it takes possession all night of the Fancy. It has\\nwitchcraft in every page of it. -- Oh! I feel an emotion even while\\nI am relating this: Methinks I see Pamela at this instant, with all\\nthe Pride of Ornament cast off.\\'\\nFielding\\'s mockery was not undeserved; some of the scenes in\\nPamela are more suggestive than anything in Boccaccio\\'s\\nDecameron, for example, although it is at first sight difficult to\\nsee why this should be so, given Richardson\\'s virtuous\\nintentions. One reason is certainly the greater secrecy\\nsurrounding sex in Richardson and his society. In Boccaccio the\\nprotagonists of both sexes freely avow their sexual feelings; and\\ntheir deeds are related orally to a mixed audience without\\nanyone being very seriously shocked, or even excited. Things\\nwere very different in the world of Richardson, and the secrecy\\nsurrounding the sexual life meant that every move made by Mr.\\n216\\nB. engaged the shocked attention of Richardson\\'s readers much\\nmore thoroughly than Boccaccio\\'s treatment of the sexual act\\nitself.\\nAnother reason is probably to be found in the superficial decency\\nof Richardson\\'s descriptions-what Lawrence tellingly described as\\nRichardson\\'s union of \\'calico purity and underclothing\\nexcitements\\'. 1 The moralists who approved of Pamela might well\\nhave heeded Dennis\\'s argument that \\'it is a very great error in\\nsome persons at present, to be so shy of bawdy, and so fond of\\nlove. For obscenity cannot be very dangerous, because it is rude\\nand shocking; but love is a passion, which is so agreeable to the\\nmovements of corrupted nature, that by seeing it livelily touched\\nand often represented, an amorous disposition insensible\\ninsinuates itself into the chastest breast.\\' 2 There is, indeed,\\nsome reason to believe that Richardson himself was not unaware\\nof this antinomy; he remarked contemptuously of Sterne that\\n\\'one extenuating circumstance attends his works, that they are\\ntoo gross to be inflaming\\'. 3 He might have said the same of\\nBoccaccio, and we might reply that nothing could be less gross\\nand yet more \\'inflaming\\' than some of the passages in Pamela.\\n____________________\\n1 \" Introduction to These Paintings\", Phoenix, ed. MacDonald (\\nLondon, 1936), P. 552.\\n2 \" A Large Account of Taste in Poetry\", Critical Works, I, 284.\\n3 C orrespondence, V, 146.\\n-203-\\nThe main reason, however, why Richardson\\'s erotic scenes are\\nso much more suggestive than Boccaccio\\'s is merely that the\\nfeelings of the actors involved are so much more real. We cannot\\nknow Boccaccio\\'s characters in the Decameron, since they are\\nonly necessary devices for the presentation of an amusing\\nsituation; we do know Richardson\\'s characters, and his\\nexhaustive treatment of their reactions to each incident makes\\nus imagine that we are participating in every fascinating advance\\nand retreat as it is reflected in Pamela\\'s excited sensibility.\\nThe major objection, however, to Pamela and to the novelette\\ntradition it inaugurates, is perhaps not so much that it is\\nsalacious but that it gives a new power to age-old deceptions of\\nromance.\\nThe story of Pamela, of course, is a modern variant of the ageold\\nCinderella theme. As the original occupations of both the\\n217\\nheroines suggest, both stories are essentially compensations for\\nthe monotonous drudgery and limited perspectives of ordinary\\ndomestic life. By projecting themselves into the position of the\\nheroine the readers of Pamela were able to change the\\nimpersonality and boredom of the actual world into a gratifying\\npattern whose every element was converted into something that\\ngave excitement and admiration and love. Such are the\\nattractions of romance, and Richardson\\'s novel bears everywhere\\nthe marks of its romance origin -- from Pamela\\'s name, which is\\nthat of Sidney\\'s princess in the Arcadia, to her assertion of the\\npastoral heroine\\'s freedom from economic and social realities\\nwhen she proposes to seek refuge in nature and \\'live, like a bird\\nin winter, upon hips and haws\\'. 1 But it is romance with a\\ndifference: the fairy godmother, the prince and the pumpkin are\\nreplaced by morality, a substantial squire and a real coach-andsix.\\nThis is no doubt the reason why Richardson, who so rarely gave\\nhis approval to any fiction except his own, was able to forget\\nhow close he was to providing exactly the same satisfactions as\\nthe romances he derided. His attention was so largely focussed\\non developing a more elaborate representational technique than\\nfiction had ever seen before that it was easy to overlook the\\ncontent to which it was being applied-to forget that his narrative\\nskill was actually being used to re-create the pseudo-realism of\\nthe daydream, to give an air of authenticity\\n____________________\\n1 P amela, I, 68.\\n-204-\\nto a triumph against all obstacles and contrary to every\\nexpectation, a triumph which was in the last analysis as\\nimprobable as any in romance.\\nThis combination of romance and formal realism applied both to\\nexternal actions and inward feelings is the formula which\\nexplains the power of the popular novel: it satisfies the romantic\\naspirations of its readers in a literary guide which gives so full a\\nbackground and so complete an account of the minute-by-minute\\ndetails of thought and sentiment that what is fundamentally an\\nunreal flattery of the reader\\'s dreams appears to be the literal\\ntruth. For this reason, the popular novel is obviously liable to\\nsevere moral censure where the fairy story or the romance is\\nnot: it pretends to be something else, and, mainly owing to the\\nnew power which accrued to formal realism as a result of the\\n218\\nsubjective direction which Richardson gave it, it confuses the\\ndifferences between reality and dream more insidiously than any\\nprevious fiction.\\nThe confusion itself, of course, was not new, at least since Don\\nQuixote. But if we compare Don Quixote with Madame Bovary,\\nits classic equivalent as regards the effects of the novel, the\\nresult of the novel form\\'s apparent realism of action and\\nbackground combined with its focus on the emotional life of the\\ncharacters become apparent. Don Quixote is, after all, mad, and\\nthe distortions produced by romance issue in actions whose\\nridiculous unreality is evident to everyone, and even, eventually,\\nto himself; whereas Emma Bovary\\'s conception of reality and her\\nown role in it, though equally distorted, is not seen to be so by\\nher or by anyone else because its distortions exist primarily in\\nthe subjective sphere, and the attempt to carry them out does\\nnot involve any such obvious collisions with reality as those of\\nCervantes\\'s hero: she is mistaken, not about sheep and\\nwindmills but about herself and her personal relationships.\\nIn this Emma Bovary pays involuntary tribute to the way in\\nwhich the novel\\'s access to the inner life gives it a more\\npervasive and enduring sway than the romance, and one which\\nis much more difficult either to escape or to assess. As far as this\\nsway is concerned, indeed, the question of literary quality is not\\nof first importance. For good and ill the novel\\'s power over\\nprivate experience has made it a major formative influence on\\nthe expectations and aspirations of the modern consciousness;\\nas Madame de Staël truly wrote:... \\'les romans, même les\\n-205-\\nplus purs, font du mal; il nous ont trop appris ce qu\\'il y a de plus\\nsecret dans les sentiments. On ne peut plus rien éprouver sans\\nse souvenir presque de l\\'avoir lu, et tous les voiles du coeur ont\\nété déchirés. Les anciens n\\'auraient jamais fait ainsi de leur âme\\nun sujet de fiction.\\' 1\\nThe development of the novel\\'s concentration on private\\nexperience and personal relationships is associated with a series\\nof paradoxes. It is paradoxical that the most powerful vicarious\\nidentification of readers with the feelings of fictional characters\\nthat literature had seen should have been produced by exploiting\\nthe qualities of print, the most impersonal, objective and public\\nof the media of communication. It is further paradoxical that the\\nprocess of urbanisation should, in the suburb, have led to a way\\nof life that was more secluded and less social than ever before,\\n219\\nand, at the same time, helped to bring about a literary form\\nwhich was less concerned with the public and more with the\\nprivate side of life than any previous one. And finally, it is also\\nparadoxical that these two tendencies should have combined to\\nassist the most apparently realistic of literary genres to become\\ncapable of a more thorough subversion of psychological and\\nsocial reality than any previous one.\\nBut the novel is capable of great illumination too, and so it is\\nnatural that our feelings about the genre itself and its social\\ncontext should be mixed. Perhaps the most representative and\\ninclusive presentation of the problem in all its dubieties is to be\\nfound in the supreme culmination of the formal trend that\\nRichardson initiated -- James Joyce Ulysses. No book has gone\\nbeyond it in the literal transcription of all the states of\\nconsciousness, and no book in doing so has depended more\\ncompletely on the medium of print. Further, its hero, as Lewis\\nMumford has pointed out, is a very complete symbol of the urban\\nconsciousness, regurgitating \\'the contents of the newspaper and\\nthe advertisement, living in a hell of unfulfilled desires, vague\\nwishes, enfeebling anxieties, morbid compulsions and dreary\\nvacuities\\'. 2 Leopold Bloom is representative, too, in his devotion\\nas a reader to the vicarious sexual prowesses offered in such\\nnovelettes as Sweets of Sin, and his relation, such as it is, with\\nhis wife, is coloured by their mutual addiction to such delights,\\nand to the clichfis they derive from them. Again\\n____________________\\n1 D e l\\'Allemagne, p. 84.\\n2 C ulture of Cities, p. 271.\\n-206-\\ntypically urban, Bloom does not belong to any one social group,\\nbut participates superficially in a great many of them; none,\\nhowever, provide him with the affectionate understanding and\\nthe stable personal relationships for which he yearns, and his\\nloneliness leads him to imagine that he has found in Stephen\\nDedalus the magic helper of folklore and daydream, the \\'real\\nfriend\\' that David Simple sought.\\nThere is nothing heroic about Bloom, nothing outstanding in any\\nway; it is difficult at first sight to see why anyone should want to\\nwrite about him; and there is, indeed, only one possible reason,\\nwhich is also the reason by which the novel in general lives:\\ndespite all that can be said against Bloom his inner life is, if we\\ncan judge, infinitely more various, more interesting and certainly\\n211\\nmore conscious of itself and its personal relationships than that\\nof his Homeric prototype. In this, too, Leopold Bloom is the\\nclimax of the tendencies we have been concerned with here: and\\nRichardson, who is surely his spiritual kin, must be explained\\nand, perhaps, justified by the same reasons.\\n-207-\\nCHAPTER VII\\nRichardson as Novelist: \\'Clarissa\\'\\nEARLY in 1741 Richardson explained to Aaron Hill that he had\\nwritten Pamela in the hope that it \\'might possibly introduce a\\nnew species of writing\\'. 1 This claim antedates that of Fielding,\\nmade the following year in the preface to Joseph Andrews, and\\nindicates that, unlike Defoe, Richardson was a conscious literary\\ninnovator.\\nThere was certainly no accidental quality about Clarissa, whose\\nplot was already in his mind in 1741, and whose actual\\ncomposition occupied him fairly continuously from 1744 to 1749\\nwhen the last volumes were published: nor can there be any\\ndoubt that in Clarissa, even more completely than in Pamela,\\nRichardson resolved the main formal problems which still\\nconfronted the novel by creating a literary structure in which\\nnarrative mode, plot, characters and moral theme were\\norganised into a unified whole. For, although Clarissa contains\\nsomething like a million words and is almost certainly the longest\\nnovel in the language, Richardson was justified in asserting that\\n\\'long as the work is, there is not one digression, not one episode,\\nnot one reflection, but what arises naturally from the subject,\\nand makes for it, and [carries] it on\\'. 2\\nI\\nRichardson\\'s use of the letter form in Clarissa was much better\\nadapted to the presentation of personal relationships than was\\nthe case in his first novel. In Pamela there was only one main\\ncorrespondence -- that of the heroine and her parents; as a\\nresult there was no direct presentation of Mr. B.\\'s point of view,\\nand our picture of Pamela herself was completely one-sided. This\\nposed a very similar critical problem to that in Moll Flanders: it\\nwas difficult to know how far the heroine\\'s own interpretation of\\nher character and actions was to be accepted. The parallel,\\n____________________\\n1 C orrespondence, I, lxxiii-lxxiv; on its date see McKillop,\\n211\\nRichardson, p. 26, n.\\n2 M cKillop, Richardson, p. 127.\\n-208-\\nindeed, can be continued, for the fact that Richardson had\\nessentially only one narrative source, Pamela herself, meant not\\nonly that he occasionally had to intervene himself as editor and\\nexplain such matters as how Pamela got from Bedfordshire to\\nLincolnshire, but, more important, that the epistolary convention\\nitself gradually broke down, the letters turned into \\'Pamela\\'s\\nJournal\\', and the later parts of the novel therefore produced a\\nkind of narrative effect not unlike that of the autobiographical\\nmemoir in Defoe.\\nIn Clarissa, however, the epistolary method carries the whole\\nburden of the story which is, therefore, as Richardson says in his\\nPostscript, a \\'dramatic narrative\\' rather than a \\'history\\'. Its main\\nand obvious difference from drama, indeed, is a significant one:\\nthe characters express themselves not by speaking but by\\nwriting letters, a distinction which is entirely in keeping with the\\ninward and subjective nature of the dramatic conflict involved.\\nThis conflict is also such as to justify the way Richardson\\norganised his narrative \\'in a double yet separate correspondence,\\nbetween two young ladies of virtue... and two gentlemen of free\\nlives\\' 1 -- the basic formal division is both an expression of the\\ndichotomisation of the sexual roles which is at the heart of\\nRichardson\\'s subject, and an essential condition of the candid\\nself-revelation by the characters which would have been inhibited\\nby a mixed correspondence.\\nThe use of two parallel series of letters, then, has great\\nadvantages, but it also presents considerable difficulties; not\\nonly because many of the actions have to be recounted\\nseparately and therefore repetitively, but because there is a\\ndanger of dispersing the reader\\'s attention between two different\\nsets of letters and replies. Richardson, however, handles the\\nnarrative sequence in such a way as to minimise these\\ndisadvantages. At times the attitudes of the protagonists to the\\nsame events are so different that we have no sense of repetition,\\nwhile at others he intervenes editorially to explain that some\\nletters have been suppressed or shortened -- the distinction,\\nincidentally, between such intervention, which is limited to\\nclarifying the handling of the original documents, and that which\\noccurs in Pamela, where the author becomes the narrator, is an\\nimportant one.\\n212\\nRichardson\\'s main method of resolving the narrative problem,\\n____________________\\n1 P reface, Clarissa. On this subject see A. D. McKillop,\\n\"Epistolary Technique in Richardson\\'s Novels\", Rice Institute\\nPamphlet, XXXVIII ( 1951), 36-54.\\n-209-\\nhowever, is to give us large groups of letters from one side or\\nthe other and to organise these major compositional units in\\nsuch a way that there is a significant relationship between the\\naction and the mode of its telling. At the outset, for example, the\\nletters between Clarissa and Anna Howe occupy most of the first\\ntwo volumes. It is only when their characters and background\\nhave been fully established, and Clarissa has taken the fateful\\nstep and placed herself in Lovelace\\'s power, that the main male\\ncorrespondence begins and at once reveals the full danger of\\nClarissa\\'s situation. The climax of the story brings another very\\neffective piece of counterpoint: the rape is announced briefly by\\nLovelace, but the reader has to undergo several hundred pages\\nof anguished expectation before hearing a word of Clarissa\\'s\\naccount of the affair, and the events that preceded it. By then\\nher death is already in sight and it precipitates another\\nsignificant reordering of the epistolary pattern: the rigid\\ncanalisation of correspondences is broken down by a flood of\\nletters surrounding Clarissa with admiring and anxious attention,\\nwhile Lovelace becomes a more and more isolated figure, to have\\nhis eventual death reported by a French travelling valet.\\nRichardson prevents the fundamental simplicity of his handling of\\nthe main epistolary structure from becoming obvious or boring\\nby a great variety of auxiliary devices. There is, first of all, the\\ncontrast between the totally different worlds of the male and\\nfemale correspondences; and within them there are further\\ncontrasts of character and temperament: Clarissa\\'s anxious\\nrestraint is juxtaposed to Anna\\'s pert volubility, and Lovelace\\'s\\nByronic alternations of mood are set off against the increasingly\\nsober tenor of Belford\\'s letters. From time to time further\\ncontrasts of tone are provided by the introduction of new\\ncorrespondents, such as Clarissa\\'s heavy Uncle Anthony,\\nLovelace\\'s illiterate servant Joseph Leman, the ridiculous pedant\\nBrand or by the inclusion of incidents of a contrasted kind,\\nvarying from the full-dress description of the moral and physical\\nsqualor of Mrs. Sinclair\\'s death to the social comedy of some of\\nthe disguise scenes in which Lovelace participates.\\n213\\nFor -- contrary to general opinion -- Richardson had considerable\\nhumorous gifts. Much has been made of his unintentional\\nhumour, and Clarissa is certainly not free from it -- witness the\\nletter where Clarissa informs her Cantabrigian brother that she\\n-210-\\nis \\'truly sorry to have cause to say that I have heard it often\\nremarked, that your uncontrolled passions are not a credit to\\nyour liberal education\\'. 1 But there is also a great deal of\\neffective conscious humour in the novel; Fielding found \\'much of\\nthe true comic force\\' in the widow Bevis, 2 and some very lively\\nand sardonic irony is obtained, especially in the central portions\\nof the book, from the interplay of characters and of their very\\ndifferent standards and assumptions. One brief example must\\nsuffice. After the dinner in Mrs. Sinclair\\'s parlour before Clarissa\\nrealises the true nature of the establishment, Lovelace dryly\\nreports Clarissa\\'s approving comment on the dissolute Sally\\nMartin\\'s quite imaginary prospective alliance with a woollen\\ndraper: \\'What Miss Martin particularly said of marriage, and of\\nher humble servant, was very solid\\'. 3 The comment enforces the\\npathos of Clarissa\\'s charitable ignorance, and yet leads us on to\\nsavour the total irony of the scene, an irony which depends upon\\nthe fact that it is Lovelace who is writing mockingly to Belford\\nabout Clarissa\\'s penchant for the \\'very solid\\'.\\nRichardson also shows great skill in varying the tempo of the\\nnarrative: after a very prolonged preparation, for example, the\\nrape is reported so swiftly that it comes as a surprise whose full\\nimpact reverberates through the atmosphere of slowly\\ndeveloping leaden horror that ensues. Such calculated\\nalternations combine with the tenor of the action itself to\\nproduce a curious and wholly characteristic literary effect.\\nRichardson\\'s very slowness communicates a sense of continual\\ntension held lightly in check: the poised, almost processional,\\ntempo of the narrative with its sudden lapses into brutality or\\nhysteria is itself the perfect formal enactment of the universe\\nwhich Clarissa portrays, a universe where the calm surface of\\nrepressive convention and ingrown hypocrisy is momentarily --\\nbut only momentarily -threatened by the irruption of the secret\\nviolences which it provokes but conceals.\\nRichardson was as careful and skilful in his characterisation as in\\nhis epistolary technique. He claimed in the Postscript that \\'the\\ncharacters are various and natural; well distinguished and\\n____________________\\n214\\nI, 138.\\n2 T his letter to Richardson was discovered by E. L.

All characters of any importance are given a\\ncomplete description, which includes an account, not only of their\\nphysical and psychological nature, but of their past life and of the\\nramifications of their family and personal relationships; while in\\nthe \\'Conclusion Supposed to be Written by Mr. Belford\\'\\nRichardson anticipates a later convention of the novel by\\nacknowledging his responsibility for all his dramatis personae and\\nrounding off his narrative with a brief account of their later\\ncareers.\\nMany modern readers, it is true, have found Clarissa too good\\nand Lovelace too bad to be very convincing, but this was not the\\nview of Richardson\\'s contemporaries, who infuriated him, as he\\nrecounts in the Postscript, by their tendency, on the one hand, to\\ncondemn the heroine as \\'too cold in her love, too haughty, and\\neven sometimes provoking\\', and on the other to succumb to the\\nhero\\'s rakish charms. \\'Oh that I could not say, that I have met\\nwith more admirers of Lovelace than of Clarissa\\', Richardson\\nlamented to Miss Grainger; 1 and this despite the fact that he\\nhad already added footnotes to his original text so as to\\nemphasise Lovelace\\'s cruelty and duplicity. This very different\\nattitude to Richardson\\'s protagonists lasted until well into the\\nnineteenth century: Balzac, for example, thought it appropriate\\nin 1837 to illustrate the point that there are always two sides to\\na question by asking, with what was certainly meant to be a\\nrhetorical flourish -- \\'Who can decide between a Clarissa and a\\nLovelace?\\' 2\\nOn the other hand, there is no doubt that it was a major part of\\nRichardson\\'s intention to establish Clarissa as a model of\\nfeminine virtue -- he stated very explicitly in the Preface that she\\nwas \\'proposed as an exemplar to her sex\\' -- and that this\\ninterposes considerable barriers between us and the heroine.\\nWhen we are told that Clarissa knew some Latin, was\\ndistinguished for the correctness of her orthography, was even \\'a\\nperfect mistress of the four rules of arithmetic\\', we find it a strain\\nto muster the proper awe.

McKillop, Richardson, p. 205.\\n2 L es Illusions perdues ( Paris, 1855), p. 306.\\n-212-\\nphilanthropy by running over the three hours allotted daily to\\nepistolary amusements; we are gratified rather than otherwise\\nwhen Clarissa bewails the fact that her fall has deprived her of\\nthe pleasure of visiting the \\'cots of my poorer neighbours, to\\nleave lessons for the boys and cautions for the elder girls\\'; and\\nwe pine for more substantial concessions to human frailty than\\nare indicated by Anna Howe\\'s admission that her friend did not\\nexcel \\'in the executive part\\' of painting. 1\\nNone of these things would have seemed so ridiculous to\\nRichardson\\'s contemporaries. Theirs was an age of very deep\\nclass distinctions; an age when the position of women was still\\nsuch as to make any effective intellectual achievement on their\\npart a legitimate cause of admiration; an age when the\\nceremonies of benevolence were commonly performed with a\\nblandly patronising pomp. Even Clarissa\\'s care in the\\nmanagement of her time, though extreme by any standard,\\nwould probably have found wide approval as a laudable\\nschematisation of an established Puritan tendency.\\nThe ideals of Richardson\\'s time and class, then, combined with\\nthe somewhat limited literary perspective prevalent in his day\\naccording to which the didactic function of art was best served by\\nmaking characters paradigms of vice or virtue, go far towards\\nexplaining much that we find incredible or uncongenial in\\nClarissa\\'s personality. But in any case such a defence is only\\nnecessary for a small part of the book -- the beginning and\\nespecially the end when she is overwhelmed in the obituary\\npieties of her friends; during most of the narrative our attention\\nis deflected from her perfections towards the tragic\\nconsequences of her error of judgement in leaving the parental\\nroof in the company of Lovelace. Nor is this all: with a\\npsychological penetration which shows how, if the need arises,\\nRichardson the novelist can silence Richardson the writer of\\nconduct books, it is made clear that this error of judgement was\\nitself the result of Clarissa\\'s very excellencies: \\'So desirous\\', she\\ntaunts herself, \\'to be considered an example! A vanity which my\\npartial admirers put into my head! And so secure in my own\\n216\\nvirtue.\\' Indeed, with a supreme objectivity, Richardson connects\\nhis heroine\\'s downfall with her attempt to realise the aims of the\\ncampaign of sexual reformation described above. Clarissa\\neventually comes to realise that she fell into Lovelace\\'s power\\n____________________\\nIV, 494, 496, 507; III, 521; IV, 509.\\n-213-\\nbecause of her spiritual pride, which led her to believe \\'that I\\nmight be an humble means in the hands of Providence to reclaim\\na man who had, as I thought, good sense enough at bottom to\\nbe reclaimed\\'. 1\\nIn the case of Clarissa, then, Richardson\\'s strong tendency\\ntowards making his characters exemplifications of some rather\\nobvious moral lesson is to a large extent redeemed by his\\nequally strong if not stronger tendency towards a very powerful\\nimaginative projection into a much more complicated\\npsychological and literary world. There is a similar qualification of\\nhis didactic tendency in his portrayal of Lovelace -- Richardson\\nrefused, for example, to satisfy the narrow moralists who wanted\\nhim to add atheism to Lovelace\\'s other sins, on the grounds that\\nthis would have made it impossible for Clarissa even to consider\\nhim as suitor. 2 But the main objections to Lovelace\\'s character\\nare of a somewhat different order: we object not so much to his\\nexemplary viciousness as to its artificial, self-conscious and\\nsingleminded quality. Richardson undoubtedly had Lothario in\\nRowe\\'s Fair Penitent ( 1703) in mind, 3 as well as several real\\npersons of his acquaintance; he had \\'always\\' been \\'as attentive\\n... to the profligate boastings, of the one sex as... to the\\ndisguises of the other\\': 4 and as a result produced a character\\nwho is not so much a real individual as a conflation of a variety\\nof rakish traits that Richardson derived partly from personal\\nobservation and partly from his considerable reading in the\\ndrama.\\nYet, although the artificial and composite elements in Lovelace\\'s\\ncharacter cannot be denied, there is, as we shall see, much else\\nthat is convincingly human about him; and, as with Clarissa, an\\nappreciation of the contemporary social context does much to\\nrelieve Richardson of the grosser charges against the credibility\\nof his creation. For the eighteenth-century rake was very\\ndifferent from its twentieth-century counterpart. Lovelace\\nbelonged to an age before the public schools had enforced a code\\nof manly reticence upon even the most hypertonic of aristocratic\\n217\\ncads; 5 nor did cricket and golf provide alternative channels for\\nthe superfluous energies of the leisured male.

Hopkinson,\\nRobert Lovelace, The Romantic Cad, Horizon, X ( August\\n1944), 80-104.\\n-214-\\nMary Wortley Montagu tells us that in 1724 one of Richardson\\'s\\npossible models for Lovelace, Philip, Duke of Wharton, was the\\nmoving spirit in a \\'committee of gallantry\\', the Schemers, who\\nmet \\'regularly three times a week to consult on gallant schemes\\nfor the advantage and advancement of that branch of\\nhappiness\"; 1 and there is much other evidence to suggest that a\\nsingle-minded devotion to the chase was the exception rather\\nthan the rule among the gentry of the time, and that many of\\nthe younger set differed from Squire Western only in preferring a\\nsport that had no closed season and where the quarry was\\nhuman and feminine.\\nThe moral theme of Clarissa is open to objections somewhat\\nsimilar to those against its characterisation, but there can at\\nleast be no doubt that Richardson\\'s purpose, as stated in the\\ntitle, is carried out considerably more carefully than is the case in\\nMoll Flanders. The title reads: Clarissa: or, The Histoly of a\\nYoung Lady: Comprehending the Most Important Concerns of\\nPrivate Life, and Particularly Showing the Distresses that May\\nAttend the Misconduct Both of Parents and Children, in Relation\\nto Marriage. What follows bears this description out: both parties\\nare wrong -- the parents in trying to force Solmes on their\\ndaughter, and their daughter in entertaining the private\\naddresses of another suitor, and leaving home with him; and\\nboth parties are punished -Clarissa dies, and is shortly followed\\nto the grave by her remorseful parents, while the fates bring to\\nher sister and brother respectively the appropriate scourges of a\\nfaithless husband and a wife who brings, not the anticipated\\nfortune but only \\'a lawsuit for life\\'.\\nIn the Postscript, however, Richardson also laid claim to a much\\nlarger moral purpose. Considering that \\'when the Pulpit fails\\n218\\nother expedients are necessary\\', he resolved to \\'throw in his\\nmite\\' to reform the infidel age and to \\'steal in... the great\\ndoctrines of Christianity under the guise of a fashionable\\namusement\\'. Whether this lofty ambition is achieved is open to\\nserious question.\\nThe crux of the matter is Clarissa\\'s death. In the Postscript\\nRichardson adversely criticises previous tragedy on the grounds\\nthat \\'the tragic poets have... seldom made their heroes... in their\\ndeaths look forward to a future hope\\'. He, on the\\n____________________\\n1 L etters and Works, I, 476-477.\\n-215-\\ncontrary, prides himself that he is \\'well justified by the Christian\\nsystem, in deferring to extricate suffering virtue to the time\\nwhen it will meet with the completion of its reward\\' and goes on\\nto discuss the theory of poetic justice, with copious quotations,\\nnotably from Addison\\'s essay on the subject in the Spectator. 1\\nThis has led B. W. Downs to argue that Richardson was merely\\ncontinuing the \\'virtue rewarded\\' theme of Pamela with the single\\ndifference that he post-dated \\'the reward\\', and paid it \\'in\\ndifferent currency from that in common use at B----- Hall\\': that\\nRichardson, in fact, merely \\'substituted a transcendental for a\\nsublunary audit\\'. 2\\nAlthough a transcendental audit is aesthetically more satisfying\\nin the circumstances than the very sublunary one which is found,\\nnot only in Pamela, but in many eighteenth-century works which\\nattempt to combine the tragic mode with a happy ending, it must\\nbe admitted that Richardson has at best a shallow notion of\\nreligion: as a writer in the Eclectic Review ( 1805) said of him,\\nwith damning brevity: \\'his views of Christianity are general and\\nobscure\\'. 3 On the other hand, if all examples of Christian art --\\nor theology for that matter -- in which some form of\\ntranscendental reward played an important part were to be\\nrejected, there would be very little left, especially from the\\neighteenth century; we cannot fairly condemn Richardson too\\nstrongly either for sharing the complacent piety of his age or for\\nfailing to overcome the very general tendency of the Christian\\nview of the after-life to modify the usual effect of the death of\\nthe tragic hero.\\nIn any case, the overpowering sense of waste and defeat actually\\nconveyed by Clarissa\\'s death, combined with the fortitude she\\n219\\ndisplays in facing it, actually succeed in establishing a true tragic\\nbalance between the horror and the grandeur of Clarissa\\'s death,\\na balance which reveals an imaginative quality of a much higher\\norder than the jejune eschatology of Richardson\\'s critical defence\\nin the Postscript would suggest. Here again, however, the\\nmodern reader encounters what seems to be an insuperable\\nobstacle -- the tremendous scale on which every detail of\\nClarissa\\'s death is described, up to her embalming and the\\nexecution of her will. The reality of this obstacle must be in part\\nadmitted: to devote nearly one-third of the novel to the heroine\\'s\\ndeath is surely excessive. On the other hand, Richardson\\'s\\nemphasis can\\n____________________\\nNo. 40.\\n2 R ichardson, p. 76.\\n3 I ( 1805), 126.\\n-216-\\nbe to some extent explained on both historical and literary\\ngrounds.\\nPuritanism had been opposed to all the joyous festivals of the\\nchurch, but it had approved of protracted rituals and even of\\nemotional abandon where death and burial were concerned.\\nConsequently the scope and importance of funeral arrangements\\nhad increased until, by Richardson\\'s day, they had attained an\\nunprecedented elaboration. 1 Once again, therefore, it would\\nseem that what appears to be a false note to us in Clarissa is\\nalso evidence of how Richardson, for good and ill, acted as a\\nsounding board for the dominant notes of his age, and in this\\ncase, incidentally, for a note which has echoed from the\\nPyramids to the cemeteries of twentieth-century Los Angeles.\\nThe later part of Clarissa, in fact, belongs to a long tradition of\\nfuneral literature. J. W. Draper has shown how one specifically\\nPuritan contribution to poetry was the Funeral Elegy; 2 and\\ndeath-bed reflections were often published separately as\\npamphlets for evangelical purposes. Eventually both these subliterary\\ngenres developed into a larger literary trend which\\nexploited all the thoughts and emotions concerned with death\\nand burial; and it was the decade in which Clarissa was published\\nthat saw the triumph of this movement in such works as Blair\\nThe Grave ( 1743), Edward Young Night Thoughts on Life, Death,\\nand Immortality ( 1742-1745) and Hervey very popular\\nMeditations among the Tombs ( 1746-1747), the last two of\\n221\\nwhich Richardson printed. 3\\nTheological works dealing with death were also among the bestsellers\\nof the time -- among them Drelincourt\\'s On Death, to\\nwhich Defoe The Apparition of Mrs. Veal was commonly\\nappended. It was undoubtedly part of Richardson\\'s intentions to\\nsupply another work of this kind, a conduct book for death and\\nburial. He wrote to Lady Bradshaigh hoping that she would place\\nClarissa on her shelf with Jeremy Taylor Rule and Exercises of\\nHoly Living and Holy Dying;4 and would have been happy to\\nknow that Thomas Turner, grocer of East Hoathly, and a\\n____________________\\n1 S ee H.

This\\nwas one of the main themes of Young Night Thoughts; and\\nRichardson himself was responsible for the insertion into Young\\nConjectures on Original Composition of the story of how Addison\\nhad called a young unbeliever to his bedside so that he could\\n\\'see in what peace a Christian can die\\'. 2 To us Clarissa\\'s\\npreoccupation with her own coffin can only seem morbid\\naffectation; but it must have seemed a convincing confirmation\\nof her saintly fortitude to an age which made Newgate criminals\\nabout to be executed kneel round a coffin on their last Sunday\\nalive while the \\'condemned sermon\\' was preached. 3\\n221\\nTo his contemporaries, then, Richardson\\'s funerary emphasis\\nwould have seemed justified for its own sake; and we, perhaps,\\ncan only try to regard it in the same light as we do a good deal\\nof baroque memorial sculpture -- forget the crushing banality of\\nthe symbolism and notice only the elaborate assurance of its\\npresentation. At the same time we must recognise that there are\\nstrong literary reasons why Richardson should have placed such\\nan emphasis on the death of his heroine. A very considerable\\nlength of time is required before we can forget the sordid scenes\\nthrough which Clarissa has passed and remember only the final\\nradiance, the \\'sweet smile\\' that remains on her face when\\nColonel Morden opens the coffin.

The epistolary\\nmethod, it is true, lacks the pace and crispness of Defoe\\'s\\nnarrative manner, but Clarissa is, what Moll Flanders is not, a\\nwork of serious and coherent literary art, and one which, by the\\nalmost unanimous consent of his contemporaries at home and\\nabroad, was the greatest example of the genre ever written: Dr.\\n222\\nJohnson called Richardson \\'the greatest genius that had shed its\\nlustre on this path of literature\\', and considered Clarissa \\'the first\\nbook in the world for the knowledge it displays of the human\\nheart\\', 2 while Rousseau wrote in the Lettre à d\\' Alembert (\\n1758) that \\'no one, in any language, has ever written a novel\\nthat equals or even approaches Clarissa\\'. 3\\nThat this is not the modern view does not prove that it is wrong;\\nbut it is undeniable that the moral and social preoccupations of\\nthe age obtrude themselves much more insistently in Clarissa\\nthan in the novels of Defoe or of Richardson\\'s great\\ncontemporaries, and thus tend to render it much less\\nimmediately palatable to the modern reader ( Defoe\\'s moralising,\\nwe have seen, is usually viewed ironically today; while Fielding,\\nSmollett and Sterne, being primarily comic or satirical writers, do\\nnot demand our acceptance of their positive standards in the\\nsame way). This, combined with the enormous length of Clarissa,\\nand Richardson\\'s occasional tendency to a harrowing moral and\\nstylistic vulgarity in which Dreiser is perhaps his only peer among\\nthe great novelists, has denied the first masterpiece of the novel\\nform the tribute which it so freely earned in its own day, and to\\nwhich it is still largely entitled.\\n____________________\\nIV, 398, 327, 347.\\n2 J ohnsonian Miscellanies, ed.

McKillop, Richardson, p. 279.\\n-219-\\nIt is entitled to it primarily because Richardson\\'s very\\nresponsiveness to the dictates of his time and his class, which\\ndid much to render Clarissa unpalatable today, also helped to\\nmake it a more modern novel in a sense than any other written\\nin the eighteenth century. Richardson\\'s deep imaginative\\ncommitment to all the problems of the new sexual ideology and\\nhis personal devotion to the exploration of the private and\\nsubjective aspects of human experience produced a novel where\\nthe relationship between the protagonists embodies a universe of\\nmoral and social conflicts of a scale and a complexity beyond\\nanything in previous fiction; after Clarissa one has to wait until\\nJane Austen or Stendhal for a comparable example of a work\\nwhich develops so freely and so profoundly under the impetus of\\nits own fictional imperatives.\\nRichardson was, as has often been noted, obsessed by class\\ndistinctions. Not consciously perhaps; he seems rather to have\\n223\\ncombined an acute sense of class differences with something of\\nthe moral democracy of the earlier Puritans which eventually led\\nto the Victorian view as expressed by G. M. Young that \\'the great\\ndividing line... is... the respectable and the others\\'. 1 Some such\\nduality is perhaps responsible for the very unsatisfactory\\ntreatment of the class issue in Pamela: virtuous indignation at\\nupper-class licentiousness jars very unpleasantly with the\\nheroine\\'s abject regard for Mr. B.\\'s social status. In Clarissa,\\nhowever, and perhaps because there is nothing like the same\\nsocial distance between hero and heroine, Richardson achieves a\\nmuch more powerful rendering not only of the social conflict\\nitself, but of its moral implications.\\nBoth Clarissa and Lovelace come from the wealthy landed gentry\\nand have aristocratic connections. Those of the Harlowes,\\nhowever, are only on the mother\\'s side, and they are in no sense\\nthe equivalent of Lovelace\\'s uncle, Lord M., or his titled halfsisters.\\nThe Harlowe \\'darling view\\', as Clarissa bitterly explains,\\nis that of \\'raising a family... a view too frequently... entertained\\nby families which having great substance, cannot be satisfied\\nwithout rank and title\\'. The chief repository of this ambition is\\nJames, the only son: if the family fortune, combined with those\\nof his two childless uncles, can be concentrated on him, his\\nenormous wealth and its accompanying\\n____________________\\n1 L ast Essays ( London, 1950), p. 221.\\n-220-\\npolitical interest \\'might entitle him to hope for a peerage\\'.\\nLovelace\\'s courtship of Clarissa, however, threatens the\\nrealisation of this aim. Lovelace has even higher expectations,\\nand James is afraid that his uncles may encourage the match by\\ndiverting some of their fortunes from him to Clarissa. For this\\nreason, combined with a personal animosity towards Lovelace\\nand perhaps an envious fear lest his sister outstrip him in the\\nrace for a coronet, James uses every possible means to make his\\nfamily force Clarissa to marry Solmes. Solmes is very rich but he\\nis meanly born, and in return for such a grand alliance will not\\nexpect any more dowry from Clarissa than her grandfather\\'s\\nestate, which is already hers and whose loss therefore cannot in\\nany case be avoided. 1\\nAt the outset, therefore, Clarissa is placed in a complicated\\nconflict of class and family loyalties. Solmes is most unpleasantly\\ntypical of the rising middle class: mercenary with the squalid\\n224\\nconcentration of \\'an upstart man... not born to the immense\\nriches he is possessed of\\', as Clarissa scornfully reports. He is\\ntotally devoid of social grace or intellectual cultivation, repulsive\\nphysically and a poor speller to boot. Lovelace, on the other\\nhand, seems to possess the very qualities which Clarissa misses\\nin her own environment: a generous landlord, a \\'person of\\nreading, judgement and taste\\', 2 and what is more, his suit is\\nprimarily motivated not by economic interest but by genuine\\npersonal admiration of Clarissa\\'s beauty and accomplishments.\\nAs a potential lover he is immensely superior to the males of the\\nHarlowe milieu -- not only to Solmes but to her previous suitors\\nand to Anna Howe\\'s rather tame admirer Hickman; and there is\\ntherefore every reason why Lovelace should at first represent for\\nClarissa a very desirable escape from the constrictions of the\\nHarlowe way of life, and the immediate threat of being forced to\\nmarry Solmes.\\nEvents soon demonstrate, however, that Lovelace actually\\nmenaces her freedom and self-respect even more dangerously,\\nand this for reasons also closely connected with his social\\naffiliations. Primarily, of course, it is his aristocratic\\nlicentiousness, and his cynical distaste for matrimony, which are\\nat issue, but they are accompanied by a quite conscious enmity\\nto the moral and social attitudes of the middle class in general.\\nClarissa\\'s sexual virtue is his great \\'stimulative\\' as he says, and it\\nmust\\n____________________\\nI, 53-54.\\nI, 59, 166, 12.\\n-221-\\nbe regarded as an expression of the moral superiority of her\\nclass: \\'were it not for the poor and the middling\\', he comments,\\n\\'the world would probably, long ago have been destroyed by fire\\nfrom Heaven\\'. He has already deceived and ruined a Miss\\nBetterton, of a rich trading family that \\'aimed at a new line of\\ngentry\\'; and one of the factors which poisons his love of Clarissa\\nis his resolve to win a much greater victory for his caste against\\nthe Harlowe family that has insulted him, and that he despises as\\na house \\'sprung up from a dunghill, within every elderly person\\'s\\nremembrance\\'. 1\\nClarissa, therefore, is without allies, and this is fitting since she is\\nthe heroic representative of all that is free and positive in the\\nnew individualism, and especially of the spiritual independence\\n225\\nwhich was associated with Puritanism: as such she has to\\ncombat all the forces that were opposed to the realisation of the\\nnew concept -- the aristocracy, the patriarchal family system,\\nand even the economic individualism whose development was so\\nclosely connected with that of Puritanism.\\nThe authoritarian nature of the family is what precipitates\\nClarissa\\'s tragedy. Her father goes beyond what was generally\\nagreed to be his legitimate paternal rights: he demands not only\\nthat she give up Lovelace but that she marry Solmes. This she\\nmust refuse, and in an interesting letter to her Uncle John\\nenumerates the absolute dependence of her sex upon their\\nmarriage choice, and concludes that \\'a young creature ought not\\nto be obliged to make all these sacrifices but for such a man as\\nshe can love\\'. 2\\nThe patriarchal authoritarianism of the Harlowe family is\\nexacerbated by the unrestrained dominance of the dictates of\\neconomic individualism; and Clarissa is caught between the two.\\nMuch of the initial animosity that her brother and sister feel\\ntowards her is based on the fact that their grandfather has\\nsingled her out to inherit his estate. In doing so, of course, he\\nhas disregarded primogeniture, and the fact that his grandson\\nJames is the only relative who could possibly continue the family\\nname; instead he has chosen Clarissa, a younger granddaughter,\\nand this purely on grounds of personal preference, that is on\\ngrounds of an individual, not a family relationship. At the same\\ntime Clarissa\\'s plight is increased by James\\'s hatred of the\\ntraditional system of dowries: \\'daughters\\', he likes to\\n____________________\\nII, 491, 218, 147; I, 170.\\nI, 153.\\n-222-\\nsay, \\'are chickens brought up for the tables of other men\\', and\\nhe cannot bear to think that to achieve this, \\'the family stock\\nmust be impaired into the bargain\\'. 1\\nThe combination of family authority with the attitudes of\\neconomic individualism not only denies Clarissa any freedom of\\nchoice, but even leads her family to treat her with calculated\\ncruelty, on the grounds that, as her Uncle Anthony puts it, she\\nprefers \\'a noted whoremonger... before a man that is merely a\\nmoney-lover\\'. 2 Richardson here suggests how rigid middleclass\\nmorality, combined with a primary regard for material\\n226\\nconsiderations, express themselves in a concealed and\\nselfrighteous sadism; and this was recognised by one member of\\nhis circle, Jane Collier. In her Essay on the Art of Ingeniously\\nTormenting ( 1753) -- an early study of the minor persecutions\\nof genteel family life -- she comments on \\'How much must an old\\nHarlowe enjoy himself in loading a Clarissa with money, clothes,\\njewels, and etc., whilst he knows, that all she wants from him, is\\nkind looks, and kind words\\'. 3\\nA perfectly realised scene depicting this kind of persecution\\noccurs when her sister Arabella tortures Clarissa by pretending\\nnot to understand why she is unwilling to talk about the\\ntrousseau which has been ordered for her wedding with Solmes.\\nClarissa, who has been confined to her room for disobedience,\\nthus reports the visit of Arabella and her aunt:\\nMy sister left my aunt musing at the window, with her back\\ntowards us; and took that opportunity to insult me still more\\nbarbarously: for, stepping to my closet, she took up the patterns\\nwhich my mother had sent me up, and bringing them to me, she\\nspread them upon the chair by me; and, offering one, and then\\nanother, upon her sleeve and shoulder, thus she ran on, with\\ngreat seeming tranquillity, but whisperingly, that my aunt might\\nnot hear her. This, Clary, is a pretty pattern enough: but this is\\nquite charming! I would advise you to make your appearance in\\nit. And this, were I you, should be my wedding night-gown, and\\nthis my second dressed suit! Won\\'t you give orders love, to have\\nyour grandmother\\'s jewels new set? Or will you think to show\\naway in the new ones Mr. Solmes intends to present to you? He\\ntalks of laying out two or three thousand pounds in presents,\\nchild!

What!\\nSilent my dear!... 4\\n____________________\\nI, 54.\\nI, 160.\\nP. 88.\\nI, 235-236.\\n-223-\\nClarissa escapes from such oppressions and the struggle is\\ntransferred to the purely individual plane. Even here, however,\\nshe is under great disadvantages. The mere fact that she has left\\nhome to protect her own freedom and not out of love for him\\ngives deep offence to Lovelace\\'s pride; while the main issue that\\nseparates them, that of marriage, presents peculiar difficulties.\\nAs far as Lovelace is concerned, to consent to marriage is to\\n227\\nyield Clarissa too easy a triumph: it means that \\'a man is rather\\nto be her prize, than she his\\'. Lovelace therefore tries by every\\nstratagem to make her love \\'come forward and show itself\\', to\\nhave the attraction of his maleness fully acknowledged; and it is\\nonly when this fails, and he fears that \\'she presumes to think\\nthat she can be happy without me\\' that he uses force, hoping\\nthat then at least family pressure and public opinion will force\\nher to remain with him. 1\\nThe way that Lovelace exploits every disadvantage of her\\nsituation means that Clarissa continues to be confronted with the\\nissue which parental tyranny first raised -- the power of all the\\nforces which deny her sex their just equality with men. She is\\nindeed, as Richardson implies during Belford\\'s discussion of The\\nFair Penitent, engaged in the same cause as Rowe\\'s heroine\\nCalista, and asks with her:\\nWherefore are we Born with high souls, but to assert ourselves,\\nShake off this vile obedience they exact, And claim an equal\\nempire o\\'er the world? 2\\nUnlike Calista, however, and because she is pure and guiltless,\\nClarissa is eventually able to conquer her Lothario with spiritual\\nweapons. At first Lovelace proclaimed himself \\'a very Jew\\' in\\nbelieving \\'that women have no souls\\', but he is finally convinced\\nof the reality of considerations which had not previously entered\\nhis mind: Clarissa\\'s behaviour as she undergoes her terrible trials\\npersuades him that \\'justly did she tell me... that her soul was my\\nsoul\\'s superior\\'. 3 Such is the wholly unexpected result of his\\nexperiment to vanquish her with the methods he has previously\\nemployed so successfully against other members of Clarissa\\'s\\nsex: for the first time he has been brought up against the fact\\nthat the individual is ultimately a spiritual entity and that Clarissa\\nis a finer one than he.\\n____________________\\nII,426-427; III, 150.\\nAct III, sc. i.\\nII, 474; III, 407.\\n-224-\\nIn a sense, therefore, Clarissa\\'s triumph is one in which her sex\\nis irrelevant and looks forward to the new and inward ethical\\nsanction which an individualistic society requires, and of which\\nKant was to be the philosophical spokesman. His categorical\\nimperative was based on the premise that \\'persons, because\\n228\\ntheir very nature points them out as ends in themselves... must\\nnot be used merely as means\\'. 1 Lovelace uses Clarissa, as he\\nuses everybody else, as a means to gratify his pride in his caste,\\nhis sex and his intellect; Clarissa at first fails in the eyes of the\\nworld because she does not use others as means, but eventually\\nshe proves that no individual and no institution can destroy the\\ninner inviolability of the human personality. This realisation\\ncompletely cows him: as he confesses, \\'I never knew what fear\\nof man was -- nor fear of woman neither, till I became\\nacquainted with Miss Clarissa Harlowe; nay, what is most\\nsurprising, till I came to have her in my power\\'. 2\\nIf Richardson had stopped here, Clarissa would have been a work\\nanalogous to such later portrayals in the Puritan tradition of the\\ntragedy of feminine individualism as George Eliot Middlemarch\\nand Henry James Portrait of a Lady. The three novels reveal the\\nall but unendurable disparity between expectation and reality\\nthat faces sensitive women in modern society, and the difficulties\\nthat lie before anyone who is unwilling either to be used, or to\\nuse others, as a means. Richardson\\'s fascinated absorption in\\nthe sexual issue, however, produced a treatment of the theme\\nwhich is starker, less reticent, and, perhaps, even more\\nrevealing.\\nClarissa is, among other things, the supreme embodiment of the\\nnew feminine stereotype, a very paragon of delicacy. This is a\\ncrucial factor in her relations with Lovelace, who carefully\\ncontrives not to propose marriage in such a way as would enable\\nClarissa to agree without compromising her delicacy, which she\\nrefuses to do: \\'Would he have me catch at his first, his very first\\nword?\\' she asks on one occasion, and on another, when Lovelace\\ncruelly asks if she has any objections to delaying a few days until\\nLord M. can attend the wedding, she is forced by her sense of\\n\\'due decorum\\' to answer, \\'No, no, You cannot\\n____________________\\n1 F undamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals ( 1785), in\\nKant\\'s Critique of Practical Reason and Other Woks, trans.\\nAbbott ( London, 1898), p. 46.\\nIII, 301.\\n-225-\\nthink that I should imagine there can be reasons for such a\\nhurry\\'. As a result, even Anna Howe thinks that Clarissa is \\'overnice,\\nover-delicate\\', and she strongly urges that Clarissa\\n\\'condescend to clear up his doubts\\'. Richardson, however, points\\n229\\nout in a footnote that \\'it was not possible for a person of her true\\ndelicacy of mind to act otherwise than she did, to a man so\\ncruelly and insolently artful\\': and in fact Lovelace understood this\\nvery well, as he explained to Belford: \\'Never, I believe, was there\\nso true, so delicate a modesty in the human mind as in that of\\nthis lady... this has been my security all along\\'. 1\\nThe reinforced taboo on women avowing their feelings in\\ncourtship is, therefore, primarily responsible for the way that the\\ndeadlock between Clarissa and Lovelace drags out so long,\\nbecoming uglier and more desperate in the process. Richardson,\\nindeed, with remarkable objectivity, even makes Lovelace\\nchallenge the whole basis of the code. He wonders whether\\nwomen should really be proud of having \\'wilful and studied\\ndelays, imputed to them\\' over marriage: \\'are they not\\', he\\nsuggests, \\'indelicate in their affected delicacy; for do they not\\nthereby tacitly confess that they expect to be the greatest\\ngainers in wedlock; and that there is self-denial in the pride they\\ntake in delaying\\'. 2\\nLovelace is himself a representative of the masculine stereotype\\nagainst which the feminine code is a defence. He believes, for\\nexample, that the hypocritical bashfulness of the \\'passive sex\\'\\njustifies his own in using forceful methods. \\'It is cruel to ask a\\nmodest woman for her consent\\', he writes, and finds a kind of\\nsupport in the views of Anna Howe who believes that \\'our sex are\\nbest dealt with by boisterous and unruly spirits\\'. Clarissa sees\\nthat a larger issue is at stake, and pleads that a \\'modest woman\\'\\nshould \\'distinguish and wish to consort with a modest man\\' such\\nas the unexciting Hickman: but Lovelace knows better; women\\ndo not really desire such a lover -- \\'a male virgin -- I warrant!\\'\\nFor, as he rather wittily puts it, a virtuous woman can \\'expect...\\nthe confidence she wants\\' if she marries a rake, whereas she\\ncannot but consider the virtuous male \\'and herself as two parallel\\nlines; which, though they run side by side, can never meet\\'. 3\\n____________________\\nII, 28, 312, 156; I, 500; II, 156, 475.\\nII, 457.\\nIII, 214; II, 147, 73, 126; III, 82.\\n-226-\\nLovelace himself, like the rakes and heroes of Restoration drama,\\ngives his allegiance to a debased form of romantic love, thus\\nunderlining his historical role as the representative of the\\nCavalier attitude to sex, in conflict with the Puritan one\\n231\\nrepresented by Clarissa. Sexual passion is placed upon a\\ndifferent and higher plane than the institutional arrangement of\\nmarriage, and so, although the divine Clarissa Harlowe can\\nalmost make him think of \\'foregoing the life of honour for the life\\nof shackles\\', his darling hope is \\'to prevail upon her to live with\\n[him] what [he] call[s] the life of honour\\', in which he will\\npromise \\'never to marry any other woman\\', but in which their\\nfelicity will be uncontaminated by the rites of matrimony. 1\\nThat, at least, is his scheme: to win her on his own terms; with\\nalways the possibility that he can marry her afterwards, once his\\npersonality and his code have had their triumph. \\'Will not the\\ngenerality of the world acquit me, if I do marry?\\' he asks. \\'And\\nwhat is that injury which a church rite will not at any time repair?\\nIs not the catastrophe of every story that ends in wedlock\\naccounted happy?\\' 2\\nAs the world goes, Lovelace is perhaps as close to the average\\nview as Clarissa, and his attitude finds some support in the story\\nof Pamela. But Richardson was now in a much more serious\\nmood, and, as he announced in the Preface, was now determined\\nto challenge \\'that dangerous but too-commonly-received notion,\\nthat a reformed rake makes the best husband\\'. So he introduced\\nthe rape when Clarissa is unconscious from opiates, which is\\nperhaps the least convincing incident in the book, but which\\nserves a number of important moral and literary purposes.\\nFirst, and most obviously for Richardson\\'s didactic purpose, it\\nputs Lovelace wholly beyond the pale of any conception of\\nhonour, and proclaims to all the barbarity which lies below the\\ngenteel veneer of rakery; this Lovelace himself comes to realise,\\nand curses himself for having taken the advice of Mrs. Sinclair\\nand her crew. Not, of course, out of moral compunction, but\\nbecause it is an admission of complete defeat: in his own eyes,\\nsince, as he says, \\'there is no triumph in force. No conquest over\\nthe will\\': 3 and in the eyes of the world, since, as John Dennis\\ncynically remarked, \\'A rape in tragedy is a panegyrick upon the\\nsex... for... the woman... is supposed to remain innocent, and to\\nbe pleased without her consent; while the man, who is ac-\\n____________________\\nI, 147; II, 496.\\nIII, 281.\\nII, 398.\\n-227-\\n231\\ncounted a damned villain, proclaims the power of female charms,\\nwhich have the force to drive him to so horrid a violence\\'. 1\\nOnce Lovelace has found that, contrary to his expectation, it is not a\\ncase of \\'once overcome... for ever overcome\\', Clarissa is able to\\ndemonstrate the falsity of his view of the feminine code, and defy\\nhim in the famous words, \\'That man who has been the villain to me\\nthat you have been shall never make me his wife\\'. Clarissa\\'s sense\\nof her own honour is much more important than her reputation in\\nthe eyes of the world; the code, in fact, is not a hypocritical sham;\\nLovelace\\'s assumption that \\'the for-better and for-worse\\nlegerdemain\\' would \\'hocus pocus... all the wrongs I have done Miss\\nHarlowe into acts of kindness and benevolence to Mrs. Lovelace\\' is\\ncompletely disproved, and he succumbs to such \\'irresistible proofs\\nof the love of virtue for its own sake\\'. 2\\nIf this were all, the conflict in Clarissa would still, perhaps, be too\\nsimple for a work of such length. Actually, however, the situation is\\nmuch more complex and problematic.\\nFreud showed how the artificiality of the modern sexual code must\\nincline [the members of society] to concealment of the truth, to\\neuphemism, to self-deception, and to the deception of others\\'. 3 In\\nPamela this self-deception produces irony: the reader contrasts the\\nheroine\\'s pretended motives with her transparent but largely\\nunconscious purpose. In Clarissa, however, a similar unawareness\\nof sexual feeling on the heroine\\'s part, which by others may be\\ninterpreted as gross lack of self-knowledge, if not actual dishonesty,\\nbecomes an important part of the dramatic development, deepening\\nand amplifying the overt meaning of the story.\\nJohnson observes of Clarissa that \\'there is always something which\\nshe prefers to truth\\'. 4 But Anna Howe justly points out that as far\\nas women\\'s communication with men is concerned, this duplicity is\\nimposed by the sexual code: for, as she says, if a woman writes\\n\\'her heart to a man practised in deceit, or even to a man of some\\ncharacter, what advantage does it give him over her!\\' 5 The real\\ntragedy, however, is that the code also makes Clarissa withhold her\\nsexual feelings from Anna Howe,\\n____________________\\n1 C ritical Works, II, 166\\nIII, 318, 222, 412, 222.\\n3 C ivilised\" Sexual Morality and Modern Nervousness, Collected\\nPapers ( London, 1924), II, 77.\\n4 J ohnsonian Miscellanies, I, 297.\\nIII, 8.\\n232\\n-228-\\nand even from her own consciousness, and it is this which\\ncreates the main psychological tension in the early volumes, for\\nwhich Johnson particularly admired Richardson. 1 The\\ncorrespondence of Clarissa, and, to a lesser extent, of Lovelace,\\nis an absorbing study because we can never assume that any\\nstatement should be taken as the complete and literal truth.\\nPerhaps one of the reasons for Johnson\\'s admiration was that,\\nalthough as we have seen he believed that a man\\'s \\'soul lies\\nnaked\\' in his letters, he also knew that \\'There is... no transaction\\nwhich offers stronger temptations to fallacy and sophistication\\nthan epistolary intercourse\\'. 2\\nThe counterpoint of these unconscious duplicities in the early\\nvolumes is built upon the fact that Anna believes that Clarissa is\\nin love with Lovelace, and does not believe Clarissa\\'s\\nprotestations that her elopement was entirely accidental and\\ninvoluntary on her part. After the marriage has been long\\ndelayed, Anna Howe even thinks it necessary to write to Clarissa:\\n\\'What then have you to do but to fly this house, this infernal\\nhouse! Oh that your heart would let you fly the man!\\' Lovelace, it\\nis true, seizes the letter, and Clarissa escapes on her own\\ninitiative. Nevertheless, until half the book is done, there is a\\ngenuine ambiguity about the situation in everyone\\'s mind; we\\nare fully entitled to suspect Clarissa herself of not knowing her\\nown feelings: and Lovelace is not altogether wrong in suspecting\\nher of the \\'female affectation of denying [her] love\\'. 3.\\nAs the story develops, Clarissa herself gradually makes this\\ndiscovery. Very early she has cause to wonder \\'what turn my\\nmind had taken to dictate so oddly to my pen\\' in the course of a\\nletter about Lovelace; and her debates with Anna Howe about\\nher real attitude to him eventually force her to question whether\\nher original hope that she could reform Lovelace was not actually\\na mask for less creditable motives. \\'What strange imperfect\\nbeings!\\' she reflects. \\'But self here, which is at the bottom of all\\nwe do, and of all we wish, is the grand misleader.\\' \\'Once you\\nwrote\\', she confesses to Anna Howe, \\'that men of his cast are\\nthe men that our sex do not naturally dislike: while I held that\\nsuch were not (however that might be) the men we ought to\\nlike.\\' She cannot deny that she \\'could have liked Mr. Lovelace\\nabove all men\\', and that there may be some justice in\\n____________________\\n1 J ohnsonian Miscellanies, I, 282.\\n2 \" Pope\\'\", Lives of the Poets, ed.

The minor reticences and\\nconfusions revealed in the feminine correspondence are\\ninsignificant compared to the much grosser discrepancies\\nbetween Lovelace\\'s pretended attitudes to Clarissa and the\\nfalsehoods and trickeries which his letters reveal. The masculine\\ncode allows him to practise, and even openly avow, his complete\\nlack of truth and honour in his pursuit of the opposite sex. As\\nBelford points out, \\'our honour, and honour in the general\\nacceptation of the word are two things\\', and Lovelace\\'s honour is\\nsuch that he has \\'never lied to man, and hardly ever said truth to\\nwoman\\'. As a result of these revelations we realise that the code\\nwhich might seem to make Clarissa too prudent is not prudent\\nenough when measured against the outrageous means which\\nmen allow themselves to gain their ends. But if Clarissa\\'s code\\nfosters the self-ignorance which helps to place her in Lovelace\\'s\\npower, it at least does not involve conscious deception; and so\\nLovelace is forced to see that since Clarissa cannot \\'stoop to\\ndeceit and falsehood, no, not to save herself\\', Belford was right\\nwhen he asserted that \\'the trial is not a fair trial\\'. 2\\nThe sophistries both conscious and unconscious produced by the\\nsexual code, then, helped Richardson to produce a pattern of\\npsychological surprise and discovery very similar in nature to\\nthat in Pamela, although the counterpoint between feminine selfdeception\\nand masculine trickery is of a much more extended\\nand powerful kind. But Richardson\\'s explorations of the\\nunconscious forms taken by the sexual impulse also took\\n____________________\\nI, 47; II, 379, 438-439; I, 139; II, 439.\\n234\\nII, 158; IV, 445; III, 407; II, 158.\\n-230-\\nhim much further; and he added to the already complex series of\\ndualities embodied in the relationship of Lovelace and Clarissa\\nquite another range of meanings which may be regarded as the\\nultimate and no doubt pathological expression of the\\ndichotomisation of the sexual roles in the realm of the\\nunconscious.\\nThe imagery in which the relation between the sexes is rendered\\nindicates the basic tendency of Richardson\\'s thought. Lovelace\\nfancies himself as an eagle, flying only at the highest game;\\nBelford calls him \\'cruel as a panther\\'; while Anna sees him as a\\nhyena. The metaphor of the hunt, indeed, informs the whole of\\nLovelace\\'s conception of sex: he writes to Belford, for example:\\n\\'we begin when boys, with birds, and when grown up, go on with\\nwomen; and both, perhaps, in turn, experience our sportive\\ncruelty\\'. Then he gloats as he pictures \\'the charming gradations\\'\\nby which the bird yields to its captor as he hopes Clarissa will\\nyield to him, and concludes, \\'By my soul, Jack, there is more of\\nthe savage in human nature than we are commonly aware of\\'.\\nBut Jack is already aware of it, in Lovelace\\'s case at least, and\\nreplies: \\'Thou ever delightedst to sport with and torment the\\nanimal, whether bird or beast, that thou lovedst and hadst a\\npower over\\'.\\nSadism is, no doubt, the ultimate form which the\\neighteenthcentury view of the masculine role involved: and it\\nmakes the female role one in which the woman is, and can only\\nbe, the prey: to use another of Lovelace\\'s metaphors, man is a\\nspider, and woman is the predestined fly. 1\\nThis conceptualisation of the sexual life has had an illustrious\\nliterary history since Richardson. Mario Praz has seen Clarissa as\\nthe beginning of what he calls \\'the theme of the persecuted\\nmaiden\\', a theme which was taken up by de Sade, and played an\\nimportant part in Romantic literature. 2 Later, in a somewhat\\nmilder form, this picture of the sexual relationship established\\nitself in England. The Victorian imagination was haunted by the\\nperpetual imminence of attacks on pure womanhood by cruel and\\nlicentious males, while, in a Rochester or a Heathcliff, the\\nfeminine and Puritan imaginations of Charlotte and Emily Brontë\\nproduced a stereotype of the male as a combination of terrifying\\nanimality and diabolic intellect which is equally pathological.\\n235\\n____________________\\nII, 253; IV, 269; II, 245-249, 483, 23.\\n2 T he Romantic Agony, trans. Davidson ( London, 1951), pp. 95-\\n107.\\n-231-\\nThe complement of the sadistic and sexual male is the\\nmasochistic and asexual female; and in Clarissa this conception\\nis present both in the imagery connected with the heroine and in\\nthe underlying implication of the central action. As regards\\nimagery, Clarissa, significantly, is symbolised not by the rose but\\nthe lily: Lovelace sees her on one occasion as \\'a halfbrokenstalked\\nlily, top-heavy with the overcharging dews of morning\\',\\nand Clarissa later arranges that her funeral urn be decorated\\nwith \\'the head of a white lily snapped short off, and just falling\\nfrom the stalk\\'. 1 In the realm of action, the rape itself, when\\nClarissa is unconscious from opiates, may be regarded as the\\nultimate development of the idea of the feminine sexual role as\\none of passive suffering: it suggests that the animality of the\\nmale can only achieve its purpose when the woman\\'s spirit is\\nabsent.\\nEven so, Clarissa dies; sexual intercourse, apparently, means\\ndeath for the woman. What Richardson intended here is not\\nwholly clear, but it may be noted that he had already shown a\\nremarkable awareness of the symbolism of the unconscious in\\nPamela. When the heroine is still terrified of Mr. B. she imagines\\nhim pursuing her in the shape of a bull with bloodshot eyes;\\nlater, when a happy resolution is in sight she dreams,\\nappropriately enough, of Jacob\\'s ladder. 2 It is significant,\\ntherefore, that just before her elopement, Clarissa should have a\\ndream in which Lovelace stabs her to the heart; then, she\\nreports, he \\'tumbled me into a deep grave ready dug, among two\\nor three half-dissolved carcasses; throwing in the dirt and earth\\nupon me with his hands, and trampling it down with his feet\\'. 3\\nThe dream is primarily a macabre expression of her actual fear of\\nLovelace; but it is also coloured by the idea that sexual\\nintercourse is a kind of annihilation.\\nThis connection haunts the later part of the story. Though afraid\\nof Lovelace, she goes off with him; and later, when his intentions\\nare becoming more evident, she several times offers him knives\\nor scissors to kill her with. One of these occasions is thus\\nreported by Lovelace: \\'baring, with a still more frantic violence,\\npart of her enchanting neck, Here, here, said the soulharrowing\\nbeauty, let thy pointed mercy enter\\'. Unconsciously, no doubt,\\n236\\nClarissa courts sexual violation as well as death; and when the\\nviolation comes its equation with death is apparent to\\n____________________\\nIII, 193; IV, 257.\\n2 P amela, I, 135, 274.\\nI, 433.\\n-232-\\nboth parties. Lovelace announces, \\'The affair is over. Clarissa\\nlives\\' -- as though the contrary might have been expected; while\\nlater Clarissa directs that if Lovelace insists \\'upon viewing her\\ndead whom he ONCE before saw in a manner dead, let his gay\\ncuriosity be gratified\\'. 1\\nIn a sense the coming death to which Clarissa here refers is a\\nworking out of her own initial masochistic fantasy: having\\nequated sex and death, and having been violated by Lovelace,\\nher self-respect requires that the expected consequence ensue:\\nher decline is as the physician says, clearly not a bodily matter\\nbut \\'a love case\\'. 2 Not much is said about the covert and\\nimplacable cause why her fate cannot be otherwise, but there is\\nnever any doubt about the fact itself: anything else would prove\\nher deepest self to have been wrong.\\nThis, of course, is not the only cause of her death, which has a\\nvery complex motivation. It is, for example, quite consistent with\\nRichardson\\'s beliefs that Clarissa should prefer death to the\\nburden of her sexual desecration, even though it is, as Lovelace\\nsays, \\'a mere notional violation\\'. 3 But there is also more than a\\nhint that what Clarissa cannot face is not so much what Lovelace\\nhas done or what the world may think about it, but the idea that\\nshe herself is not wholly blameless.\\nThis idea is most clearly expressed in one of the fragments which\\nshe writes in her delirium after the rape:\\nA lady took a great fancy to a young lion, or a bear, I forget\\nwhich -- but of a bear, or a tiger, I believe it was. It was made\\nher a present of when a whelp. She fed it with her own hand:\\nshe nursed up the wicked cub with great tenderness; and would\\nplay with it without fear or apprehension of danger... But mind\\nwhat followed: at last, somehow, neglecting to satisfy its hungry\\nmaw, or having otherwise disobliged it on some occasion, it\\nresumed its nature; and on a sudden fell upon her, and tore her\\nin pieces, And who was most to blame, I pray? The brute, or the\\n237\\nlady? The lady, surely! For what she did was out of nature, out of\\ncharacter, at least: what it did was in its own nature. 4\\nLovelace, being a man, had done only what was to be expected:\\nbut Clarissa had acted out of nature in toying with him. Looking\\nback, she perhaps remembers that Anna Howe, mocking her own\\nclaim that \\'she would not be in love with him\\n____________________\\nIII, 238, 196; IV, 416.\\nII, 468.\\nIII, 242.\\nIII, 206.\\n-233-\\nfor the world\\', had ironically congratulated her on \\'being the first\\nof our sex that ever I heard of who has been able to turn that\\nlion, Love, at her own pleasure, into a lap-dog\\'. And this bitter\\nreminder that she was wrong may have caused her to look within\\nand glimpse the truth that even she was not above what\\nLovelace calls the \\'disgraceful\\' weaknesses \\'of sex and nature\\'. 1\\nWith such a belief poisoning her mind, the need to be delivered\\nfrom the body becomes imperative; she must act out in a very\\nliteral fashion the words of St. Paul in Romans: \\'I delight in the\\nlaw of God after the inward man. But I see another law in my\\nmembers, warring against the law of my mind... O wretched man\\nthat I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\\'\\nIn a historical perspective, it seems clear, Clarissa\\'s tragedy\\nreflects the combined effects of Puritanism\\'s spiritual inwardness\\nand its fear of the flesh, effects which tend to prevent the\\ndevelopment of the sexual impulse beyond the autistic and\\nmasochistic stages. Freud and Horace are agreed that Naturam\\nexpellas furca, tamen usque recurret -- a sentiment, incidentally,\\nwhich was familiar to Richardson since Lovelace quotes it -- and\\nit is not surprising, therefore, that Clarissa\\'s Liebestod should\\nsuggest that the erotic impulse has been channelled in varied\\nand divergent directions. The perverse sensuous pleasure which\\nshe takes in every detail of the preparations for her coming\\ndeath is primarily due to the feeling that she is at least about to\\nmeet the heavenly bridegroom: \\'I am upon a better preparation\\nthan for an earthly husband\\', she proclaims. \\'Never bride was so\\nready as I am. My wedding garments are bought... the easiest,\\nthe happiest suit, that ever bridal maiden wore.\\' But her pleasure\\nin her own approaching demise also has a strong narcissistic\\nquality. Belford reports that \\'the principal device\\' she chose for\\n238\\nher coffin \\'is a crowned serpent, with its tail in its mouth, forming\\na ring, the emblem of eternity\\': emblem of eternity, doubtless,\\nbut also emblem of an endlessly selfconsuming sexual desire. 2\\nOpinions may well vary over the details of the meaning of the\\npsychopathological aspects of Clarissa, but there can at least be\\nno doubt that this was one of the directions which Richardson\\'s\\nimagination took, and that he there demonstrated a\\n____________________\\nI, 49; III, 476; see also II, 420.\\nII, 99; IV, 2, 303, 256-257.\\n-234-\\nremarkable insight into the by now notorious sophistries of the\\nunconscious and subconscious mind. Further evidence of this is\\nto be found in the scenes after the rape, and in Clarissa\\'s\\nincoherent letter to Lovelace: Fielding praised it as \\'beyond\\nanything I have ever read\\'. 1 Another great contemporary\\nadmirer, Diderot, specifically pointed to the exploration of the\\ndeeper recesses of the mind as Richardson\\'s forte -- a testimony\\nwhich carries considerable authority in the light of his own\\ntreatment of the theme in Le Neveu de Rameau. It was\\nRichardson, Diderot said, \\'qui porte le flambeau au fond de la\\ncaverne; c\\'est lui qui apprend à discerner les motifs subtils et\\ndéshonnêtes qui se cachent et se dérobent sous d\\'autres motifs\\nqui sont honnêtes et qui se hâtent de se montrer les premiers. Il\\nsouffle sur le phantôme sublime qui se présente à l\\'entrée de la\\ncaverne; et le More hideux qu\\'il masquait s\\'aperçoit.\\' 2 Such\\ncertainly is the nature of the voyage of discovery which we take\\nin Clarissa ; and the hideous Moor is surely the frightening\\nreality of the unconscious life which lies hidden in the most\\nvirtuous heart.\\nSuch an interpretation would imply that Richardson\\'s imagination\\nwas not always in touch with his didactic purpose; but this, of\\ncourse, is in itself not unlikely. The decorous exterior, the\\nponderous voice of the lay bishop, expresses an important part\\nof Richardson\\'s mind, but not all of it; and, his subjects being\\nwhat they were, it is likely that only a very safe ethical surface,\\ncombined with the anonymity of print, and a certain tendency to\\nself-righteous sophistry, were able to pacify his inner censor and\\nthus leave his imagination free to express its profound interest in\\nother areas of experience.\\nSome such process seems to have occurred in Richardson\\'s\\n239\\nportrayal of Lovelace as well as of Clarissa. There was probably a\\nmuch deeper identification with his rake than he knew, an\\nidentification which left traces in such a remark as this of\\nLovelace: \\'Were every rake, nay, were every man, to sit down,\\nas I do, and write all that enters into his head or into his heart,\\nand to accuse himself with equal freedom and truth, what an\\narmy of miscreants should I have to keep me in countenance!\\'\\nElsewhere, the prodigious fertility of Lovelace\\'s sexual\\nimagination surely suggests a willing co-operation on the part of\\nhis creator\\'s far beyond the call of literary duty: Lovelace\\'s plan,\\nfor instance, of wreaking his revenge on Anna Howe, not only by\\nravishing\\n____________________\\n1 \" New Letter from Fielding\", p. 305\\n2 OE uvres, ed. Billy, p. 1091.\\n-235-\\nher, but in having her mother abducted for the same fell purpose\\nis a monstrously gratuitous fancy which is quite unnecessary so\\nfar as the realisation of Richardson\\'s didactic intentions are\\nconcerned. 1\\nThe ultimate effect of Richardson\\'s unconscious identification,\\nhowever, would seem to be wholly justified from an aesthetic\\npoint of view. The danger in the original scheme of the novel was\\nthat Lovelace would be so brutal and callow that the relationship\\nwith Clarissa would be incapable of supporting a developing and\\nreciprocal psychological pattern. Richardson, however,\\ndiminished the disparity between his protagonists by supplying\\ntheir personalities with psychological undertones which do\\nsomething to qualify the apparently diametrical opposition\\nbetween them. He mitigated Clarissa\\'s perfections by suggesting\\nthat her deeper self has its morbid aspects -- a suggestion which\\nactually increases the pathos of her story but which brings her\\ncloser in a sense to the world of Lovelace; and at the same time\\nhe led us to feel that, just as his heroine\\'s virtue is not without\\nits complications, so his villain\\'s vices have their pitiable aspect.\\nLovelace\\'s name -- in sound as in etymology -- means \\'loveless\\';\\n2 and his code -- that of the rake -- has, like Clarissa\\'s, blinded\\nhim to his own deepest feelings. From the beginning one side of\\nhis character is continually struggling to express its love for\\nClarissa openly and honourably, and it often almost succeeds.\\nClarissa, indeed, is aware of this undercurrent in his nature:\\n\\'What sensibilities\\', she tells him, \\'must thou have suppressed!\\n241\\nWhat a dreadful, what a judicial hardness of heart must thine be;\\nwho canst be capable of such emotions as sometimes thou hast\\nshown; and of such sentiments as sometimes have flown from\\nthy lips; yet canst have so far overcome them all, as to be\\n____________________\\nII, 492, 418-425.\\n2 S ee Ernest Weekley, Surnames ( London, 1936), p. 259.\\nNames are often a guide to unconscious attitudes, and those of\\nRichardson\\'s protagonists tend to confirm the view that he\\nsecretly identified himself with his hero -- Robert Lovelace is a\\npleasant enough name -- and even unconsciously collaborated\\nwith Lovelace\\'s purpose of abasing the heroine: \\' Clarissa\\' is\\nvery close to \\' Calista\\', Rowe\\'s impure heroine; while Harlowe\\nis very close to \\'harlot\\'. This verbal association seems to be on\\nthe verge of consciousness in a letter of Arabella\\'s to Clarissa:\\nshe tells her that James will treat her \\'like a common creature,\\nif he ever sees you\\', and then, referring to her doubts as to\\nwhether Lovelace will ever marry her, adds in a frenzy of\\ncontempt: \\'. . . this is the celebrated, the blazing Clarissa --\\nClarissa what? Harlowe, no doubt! -- And Harlowe it will be, to\\nthe disgrace of us all.\\' (II, 170-171.)\\n-236-\\nable to act as thou hast acted, and that from settled purpose and\\npremeditation.\\' 1\\nThis division in Lovelace between conscious villainy and stifled\\ngoodness provides yet another satisfying formal symmetry to the\\nconduct of the narrative. For, just as Clarissa began by loving\\nLovelace unconsciously and then was forced to see that, in truth,\\nhe did not deserve it, so Lovelace begins with a feeling in which\\nhate and love are mixed, but comes eventually to love her\\ncompletely, although only after he himself has made it\\nimpossible for her to reciprocate. Clarissa could perhaps have\\nmarried Lovelace, very much on her own terms, had she known\\nher own feelings earlier, and not been at first so wholly unaware,\\nand later so frightened, of her sexual component; so Lovelace\\nneed not have lost Clarissa, if he had known and been willing to\\nrecognise the gentler elements in his personality.\\nThe ultimate reason why this was impossible is, indeed, the\\nexact complement of that which causes Clarissa\\'s virtual suicide:\\nboth their fates show the havoc brought about by two codes\\nwhich doom their holders to a psychological attitude which\\nmakes human love impossible, since they set an impenetrable\\n241\\nbarrier between the flesh and the spirit. Clarissa dies rather than\\nrecognise the flesh; Lovelace makes it impossible for her to love\\nhim because he, too, makes an equally absolute, though\\nopposite, division: if he wishes \\'to prove her to be either angel or\\nwoman\\', Clarissa has no alternative but to make the choice she\\ndoes, reject her physical womanhood, and prove, in Lovelace\\'s\\nwords, that \\'her frost is frost indeed\\'. At the same time for him\\nalso the only possibility of salvation lies in the rejection of his\\nown illusion of himself which, like Clarissa\\'s, is ultimately a\\nprojection of false sexual ideology. \\'If I give up my contrivances\\',\\nhe writes in a moment of heart-searching, \\'I shall be but a\\ncommon man.\\' But, of course, he is, like Clarissa, so deeply\\nattached to his own preconceptions of himself that he cannot\\nchange; the deadlock is complete, and, as he confesses, \\'what to\\ndo with her, or without her, I know not\\'. 2\\nFor Lovelace also, therefore, death is the only way out. His end,\\nit is true, is not a suicide, but it is like Clarissa\\'s in the sense that\\nhe has in part provoked it, and that he has been forewarned in a\\ndream, a dream where, thinking at last to embrace her, he sees\\nthe firmament open to receive her and then, left\\n____________________\\nIII, 152.\\nII, 208; III, 190, 229.\\n-237-\\nalone, the floor sinks under him and he falls into a bottomless\\nInferno. His unconscious premonition is confirmed by the event,\\nbut not before he has made expiation, admitting to his slayer\\nColonel Morden that he has provoked his destiny, and imploring\\nClarissa\\'s Blessed Spirit to look down with pity and forgiveness. 1\\nSo ends a relationship that, in this at least like those of the great\\nlovers of myth and legend, endures beyond death. Clarissa and\\nLovelace are as completely, and as fatally, dependent on each\\nother as Tristan and Isolde or Romeo and Juliet; but, in keeping\\nwith the novel\\'s subjective mode of vision, the ultimate barriers\\nthat prevent the union of Richardson\\'s star-crossed lovers are\\nsubjective and in part unconscious; the stars operate on the\\nindividual through varied psychological forces, forces which are\\neventually, no doubt, public and social, since the differences\\nbetween the protagonists represent larger conflicts of attitude\\nand ethic in their society, but which are nevertheless so\\ncompletely internalised that the conflict expresses itself as a\\nstruggle between personalities and even between different parts\\n242\\nof the same personality.\\nThis is Richardson\\'s triumph. Even the most apparently\\nimplausible, didactic or period aspects of the plot and the\\ncharacters, even the rape and Clarissa\\'s unconscionable time adying,\\nare brought into a larger dramatic pattern of infinite\\nformal and psychological complexity. It is this capacity for a\\ncontinuous enrichment and complication of a simple situation\\nwhich makes Richardson the great novelist he is; and it shows,\\ntoo, that the novel had at last attained literary maturity, with\\nformal resources capable not only of supporting the tremendous\\nimaginative expansion which Richardson gave his theme, but\\nalso of leading him away from the flat didacticism of his critical\\npreconceptions into so profound a penetration of his characters\\nthat their experience partakes of the terrifying ambiguity of\\nhuman life itself.\\n____________________\\nIV, 136, 529.\\n-238-\\nCHAPTER VIII\\nFielding and the Epic Theory of the Novel\\nSINCE it was Pamela that supplied the initial impetus for the\\nwriting of Joseph Andrews, Fielding cannot be considered as\\nhaving made quite so direct a contribution as Richardson to the\\nrise of the novel, and he is therefore given somewhat less\\nextensive treatment here. His works in any case raise very\\ndifferent problems, since their distinguishing elements have their\\nroots not so much in social change as in the neo-classical literary\\ntradition. This in itself may be regarded as presenting something\\nof a challenge to the basic argument of the present study: if the\\nmain features of Tom Jones, for example, were in fact the result\\nof an independent and autonomous development within the\\nAugustan world of letters, and if these features later became\\ntypical of the novel in general, it is evident that the crucial\\nimportance attributed above to the role of social change in\\nbringing about the rise of the new form could hardly be\\nsustained.\\nFielding\\'s celebrated formula of \\'the comic epic in prose\\'\\nundoubtedly lends some authority to the view that, far from\\nbeing the unique literary expression of modern society, the novel\\nis essentially a continuation of a very old and honoured narrative\\ntradition. This view is certainly widely enough held, albeit in a\\n243\\nrather general and unformulated way, to deserve consideration.\\nIt is evident that since the epic was the first example of a\\nnarrative form on a large scale and of a serious kind, it is\\nreasonable that it should give its name to the general category\\nwhich contains all such works: and in this sense of the term the\\nnovel may be said to be of the epic kind. One can perhaps go\\nfurther, and, like Hegel, regard the novel as a manifestation of\\nthe spirit of epic under the impact of a modern and prosaic\\nconcept of reality. 1 Nevertheless, it is surely evident that the\\nactual similarities are of such a theoretical and abstract nature\\nthat one cannot make much of them without neglecting most of\\nthe specific\\n____________________\\n1 S ee The Philosophy of Fine Art, trans. Osmaston ( London,\\n1920), IV, 171.\\n-239-\\nliterary characteristics of the two forms: the epic is, after all, an\\noral and poetic genre dealing with the public and usually\\nremarkable deeds of historical or legendary persons engaged in a\\ncollective rather than an individual enterprise; and none of these\\nthings can be said of the novel.\\nThey certainly cannot be said of the novels of Defoe or\\nRichardson; and as it so happens that their occasional remarks\\nabout the epic do something to illuminate the social and literary\\ndifferences between the two genres, their views on the subject\\nwill be briefly considered before Fielding\\'s conception of the epic\\nanalogy, and the nature of its contribution to his novels are\\ninvestigated.\\nI\\nApart from one rather conventional contrast between \\'the\\nimmortal Virgil\\'s... accurate judgement\\' and Homer\\'s \\'more\\nfertile and copious invention and fancy\\', 1 Defoe\\'s general\\nattitude to epic was one of casual depreciation: \\'It is easy to tell\\nyou the Consequences of Popular Confusions, Private Quarrels,\\nand Party Feuds, without Reading Virgil, Horace, or Homer\\', he\\nwrites in The Review ( 1705), 2 and in a 1711 pamphlet, The\\nFelonious Treaty, he tells us that the siege of Troy was all for\\n\\'the Rescue of a Whore\\'. 3 This view of Helen was not\\nuncommon: but the terseness of Defoe\\'s reduction of the whole\\nmatter to a simple moral judgement reminds us how the primacy\\nof ethical considerations in the literary outlook of the middle\\n244\\nclass was likely to undermine much of the prestige of classical\\nliterature. Defoe\\'s condemnation of the \\'long ago exploded...\\nLatin bawdy authors Tibullus, Propertius and others\\', 4 and his\\nlament that there was \\'not a Moralist among the Greeks but\\nPlutarch\\', 5 may serve as further confirmations of this tendency.\\nIf Defoe did not approve of Homer as a moralist he was even\\nmore explicit in condemning him as a historian. Defoe\\'s interest\\nin literature was almost exclusively dictated by his voracious\\nappetite for facts, and Homer\\'s value as a repository of fact\\nobviously had serious limitations, as did oral tradition in general.\\nThis theme occurs as early as the preface to The Storm in 1704,\\n____________________\\n1 T he Life of Mr. Duncan Campbell ( Oxford, 1841), p. 86.\\n2 N o. 39 ( 1705)\\n3 P . 17.\\n4 M ist\\'s Journal, April 5, 1719, cit.

His general thesis is that the\\nart of writing was a divine gift given by Moses which enabled\\nman to escape from \\'that most corrupting, multiplying Usage of\\nTradition\\', that is, the primitive, \\'oral History of Men and Things\\',\\nwhich in fact always tended to turn history into \\'Fable and\\nRomance\\', \\'Scoundrels\\' into \\'Heroes\\', and \\'Heroes\\' into \\'Gods\\'.\\nHomer was a very notable offender in this respect. His works are\\nirreplaceable historical documents: we should know nothing of\\n\\'the Siege of Troy, were it unsung by Homer\\'; and yet,\\nunfortunately, \\'even now we scarce know whether it is a History,\\nor that Ballad-Singer\\'s Fable to get a Penny\\'. 1\\nThis last phrase echoes Defoe\\'s most extended reference to\\nHomer, which occurs in the course of a very amusing\\nintervention in the controversy which arose over Pope\\'s\\nunacknowledged collaboration with Broome and Fenton on his\\ntranslation of the Odyssey. Writing in Applebee\\'s Journal, where\\nindiscriminate impudence was at a premium, Defoe argues that it\\nis ridiculous to single out Pope for attack, since all writers, from\\nHomer down, have been plagiarists:\\n245\\n. . . a Merry Fellow of my Acquaintance assures me, that our\\ncousin Homer himself was guilty of the same Plagiarism.

And so, the Poet never did much\\nhimself, only published and sold his Ballads still, in his own\\nName, as if they had been his own; and by that, got great\\nSubscriptions, and a high Price for them. 2\\nDefoe had close precedents for this picture of Homer -d\\'Aubignac\\nand Perrault in France, and more recently Bentley\\n____________________\\n1 P p. 115, 17, 115, 117.\\n2 J uly 31, 1725; Defoe\\'s two letters on the topic are reprinted in\\nLee (III, 410-414).\\n-241-\\nand Henry Felton in England, had seen the Homeric poems as\\ncollections of the songs of a strolling bard; 1 but the account of\\nHomer as a plagiary and a successful literary entrepreneur\\nseems to have been invented to suit the argument of the\\nmoment. Defoe\\'s strategy -- to reduce all literary matters to\\ntheir commercial equivalent -- is perfectly calculated not only to\\nundermine the prestige of epic and the classical premises of\\nAugustan culture, but also to reduce the great ones of literature\\nto the same low Grub Street level to which they had\\ncontemptuously relegated him.\\nDefoe had yet another important objection to Homer -- the fact\\nthat he shared the pagan credulity of his age. One of his\\nconclusions in A System of Magic ( 1727) is that \\'the Greeks\\nwere the most superstitious of all the Devil-worshippers in the\\nWorld, worse than the Persians and Chaldeans\\', and that their\\nreligious literature was vitiated by the \\'infernal juggles\\' of the\\ndevil who continually \\'chops in\\' with \\'a horrid Rhapsody of\\ncomplicated Idolatry\\'. 2 In another work, The History and Reality\\nof Apparitions ( 1727), Defoe examines the statements of Homer\\n246\\nand Virgil on apparitions, and concludes scornfully: \\'What learned\\nNonsense, and what a great deal of it is here, to reconcile a\\nthing, which, upon the Christian foundation, is made as easy as\\nanything not immediately visible to the common eye can be\\nmade!\\' 3\\nThis note of hardly concealed impatience at the irrational and\\nimmoral idolatry of the ancients is a suitable one on which to\\nleave Defoe. Homer could have been a most valuable source of\\nhistorical evidence.

His most outspoken attack occurs in a letter to Lady\\nBradshaigh, who had apparently initiated a correspondence with\\nhim on the dire consequences of epic poetry:\\nI admire you for what you say of the fierce, fighting Iliad.\\nScholars, judicious scholars, dared they to speak out, against a\\nprejudice of thousands of years in its favour, I am persuaded\\nwould find it possible for Homer to nod, at least. I am afraid this\\npoem, noble as it truly is, has done infinite mischief for a series\\nof ages; since to it, and its copy the Eneid, is owing, in a great\\nmeasure, the savage spirit that has actuated, from the earliest\\n247\\nages to this time, the fighting fellows, that, worse than lions or\\ntigers, have ravaged the earth, and made it a field of blood. 1\\nThe ideas in the attack are not original. Pope had written that\\n\\'the most shocking\\' thing in Homer was \\'that spirit of cruelty\\nwhich appears too manifestly in the Iliad\\'. 2 And it is obvious that\\nsince, in epic, warfare is \\'an essential rather than an accessory\\', 3\\nits moral world stands for values which are alien and unwelcome\\nto the members of a peace-loving society. Richardson, however,\\ngoes a good deal further, and his talk of the \\'infinite mischief\\'\\ndone by the Aeneid is substantially new, and anticipates Blake\\'s\\nmore general accusation that \\'. . . it is the Classics... that\\nDesolate Europe with Wars\\'. 4\\nThe dangerous sanction which the prestige of epic afforded\\nvicious models of individual behaviour was an abiding\\npreoccupation with Richardson. In Grandison Lady Charlotte\\nrepeats his views as given to Lady Bradshaigh almost verbatim,\\nbut finishes by broadening the charge:\\n. . . men and women are cheats to one another.

Of what\\nviolences, murders, depredations, have not the epic poets been\\nthe occasion, by propagating false honours, false glory, and false\\nreligion? 1\\nThe epic\\'s false code of honour, like that of heroic tragedy, was\\nmasculine, bellicose, aristocratic and pagan: it was therefore\\nwholly unacceptable to Richardson, whose novels are largely\\ndevoted to attacking this ideology, and replacing it by a radically\\ndifferent one in which honour is internal, spiritual, and available\\nwithout distinction of class or sex to all who had the will to act\\n248\\nmorally.\\nRichardson\\'s fullest demonstration of the new type of heroism\\nwas Sir Charles Grandison, the result, he stated in his Preface, of\\nthe insistence of his friends that he \\'produce into public view the\\ncharacter and actions of a man of TRUE HONOUR\\': and it makes\\nmuch of the crucial social issue on which the new and the old\\ncodes of honour differ -- the question of duelling. Although\\nGrandison is an admirable swordsman, he is so determined an\\nopponent of this barbarism that he even refuses a challenge. In\\nthe \\'Concluding Note\\' Richardson defended this course of action\\nvery strongly. He reiterated Harriet Byron\\'s opposition to the old\\ncode -- \\'Murderous, vile word honour!... the very opposite to\\nduty, goodness, piety, religion...\\'; 2 pointed out that the \\'notion\\nof honour is evidently an absurd and mischievous one\\'; and\\ninsisted that challenges to a duel are nothing less than \\'polite\\ninvitations to murder\\' which every man of Christian principles\\nshould refuse, since \\'true bravery is to adhere to all duties under\\ndisadvantages\\'.\\nThere is much else in Grandison, as well as in Pamela and\\nClarissa, to support the view that Richardson\\'s novels are the\\nclimax of a long-standing movement in Christian and middleclass\\napologetics against the glamour of the pagan and warrior virtues.\\nSteele had wondered \\'why the Heathen struts, and the Christian\\nsneaks in our imagination?\\' 3 Defoe had suggested as a solution\\nthat the real test of courage was \\'to dare to be good\\'. 4\\nRichardson gave models of this daring: but the conflict between\\nthe active and extroverted ideals of the Homeric world and his\\nown way of life is perhaps even more clearly shown in his\\n____________________\\n1 V I, 315\\n2 G randison, I, 304; see also Clarissa, IV, 461-463.\\n3 T he Christian Hero, ed.

This tendency\\nwas most notably expressed by Thomas Blackwell, whose\\nEnquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer ( 1735) gave a more\\ndetailed answer than ever before to the much-debated question\\nof why no later poet had been able to achieve the greatness of\\nan Iliad or an Odyssey. Blackwell\\'s main thesis was that Homer\\nhad received unique poetic advantages from his social\\nenvironment, advantages which could not be duplicated in\\neighteenth-century England; living in a period of transition\\nbetween complete barbarism and the sloth of settled commercial\\ncivilisation, Homer had rejoiced in a naturally heroic culture when\\n\\'living by Plunder gave a Reputation for Spirit and Bravery\\'. Nor\\nwas Homer\\'s audience composed of \\'the Inhabitants of a great\\nluxurious City\\', but of simpler and more martial folk who wanted\\nto listen to tales of \\'the Prowess of their Ancestors\\'. 2\\nThree of the applications which Blackwell makes of this contrast\\nare very relevant to the differences between the epic and the\\nnovel in general, and to the conditions underlying Richardson\\'s\\nliterary innovations in particular. Homer\\'s poems, Blackwell\\nwrites, were \\'made to be recited, or sung to a Company; and not\\nread in private, or perused in a Book\\'. Secondly, \\'the natural\\nGreek... covered none of his Sentiments\\' and for this reason\\nBlackwell prefers them to his contemporaries \\'with more refined\\nbut double characters\\'. Lastly, since epic portrays \\'more natural\\nManners\\', it follows not only that the contemporary writer must\\n\\'unlearn [his] daily way of life\\' if he is to \\'poetize in the higher\\nstrains\\', but that the reader of epic must project himself into\\npersons and situations that he is likely to find both unusual and\\nunpleasant. So Blackwell, with all his enthusiasm for Homer,\\ncannot but conclude that although his patron \\'may\\n____________________\\n1 C orrespondence, II, 252 ( July 20, 1750).\\n2 2 nd ed., 1736, pp. 16, 123.\\n-245-\\nregret the Silence of the Muses, yet I am persuaded your\\nLordship will join in the Wish, That we may never be the proper\\nSubject of an Heroic Poem\\'. 1\\nBlackwell\\'s views go far to explain the unpopularity of the epic\\n251\\nwith the reading public of his day, and the popularity of the\\nnovel. That the epic was unpopular can be surmised, for\\nexample, from Richardson\\'s suggestion to Aaron Hill in 1744 that\\nwhen he published his Gideon, An Epic Poem, he should not \\'call\\nit epic in the title page, since hundreds who see the title, will not,\\nat the same time, have seen your admirable definition of the\\nword\\'. 2 This unpopularity must have been connected with the\\nfact that reading epic meant a continuous effort to exclude the\\nnormal expectations of everyday contemporary life -- the very\\nexpectations which the novel exploited. Addison had already said\\nin the Spectator that when reading Homer it was difficult not to\\nfeel that \\'you were reading the History of another Species\\': 3\\nwhile Voltaire, in his early Essay on Epic Poetry ( 1727), had\\nspecifically contrasted the very different ways that the Iliad and\\nMadame de La Fayette\\'s Zaïde were read by his contemporaries:\\n\\'it is very strange, yet true, that among the most learned, and\\nthe greatest Admirers of Antiquity, there is scarce one to be\\nfound, who ever read the Iliad, with that Eagerness and Rapture,\\nwhich a Woman feels when she reads the Novel of Zaïda\\'. 4\\nNot only must the feminine devotees of Zaïde -- and Pamela -\\nhave found it difficult to identify themselves with Homer\\'s\\ncharacters; they must also have been shocked by his treatment\\nof their sex. Greek men, Blackwell tells us, were not ashamed of\\n\\'their natural appetites\\'; 5 and, as James Macpherson was later\\nto say, \\' Homer, of all ancient poets, uses the sex with least\\nceremony\\'. 6 This scandalous indelicacy supplies a further reason\\nfor Richardson\\'s antipathy -- it is noticeable that his attacks on\\nthe epic were stimulated by a feminine correspondent, and\\nexpressed mainly through his female characters. In Sir Charles\\nGrandison, for instance, Harriet Byron is a strong supporter of\\nthe claims of Christian epic and of Milton, as against Homer, and\\nshe cites Addison\\'s papers in the Spectator, as well\\n____________________\\n1 P p. 122, 340, 24, 25, 28.\\n2 C orrespondence, I, 122.\\nNo. 209.\\n4 F lorence D.

He justifies his treatment\\nof Clarissa by Virgilian precedent, asking Belford whether he is\\nnot \\'as much entitled to forgiveness on Miss Harlowe\\'s account,\\nas Virgil was on Queen Dido\\'s?\\'; and is even impudent enough to\\nargue that since he does not have \\'half the obligation to her that\\nAeneas had to the Queen of Carthage\\', there is no reason why it\\nshould not be \\'the pious Lovelace, as well as the pious Aeneas\\'. 2\\nA late eighteenth-century essayist, Martin Sherlock, expressed a\\nfairly widely held view when he wrote that Richardson\\'s\\n\\'misfortune was that he did not know the Ancients\\'. 3 The\\nopposite is much more likely to be the case, at least as far as his\\nliterary originality is concerned, and it is significant that in his\\nlater years Richardson became an ardent supporter of the\\nModerns against the Ancients. This is made clear by the part he\\nplayed in the composition of Edward Young\\'s Conjectures on\\nOriginal Composition in a Letter to the Author of Sir Charles\\nGrandison ( 1759), where, as A. D. McKillop has shown, 4 he was\\nresponsible for a general sharpening of Young\\'s polemic in the\\ndirection of a new anti-classical hierarchy of literary values. One\\ncelebrated passage of the Conjectures which was actually written\\nby Richardson suggests that he was also aware of having a\\npersonal stake in the controversy:\\nAfter all, the first ancients had no merit in being originals: they\\ncould not be imitators.

Hercules made the choice of an hero, and so\\nbecame immortal. 1\\nRichardson\\'s ulterior purpose is transparent. He had been an\\noriginal, not willy-nilly, like Homer, but by a deliberate rejection\\nof previous models. The new literary Hercules was, of course,\\nbeing brave after the event, since we have no evidence of his\\nserious concern with classical models until after the completion\\nof Clarissa. But we must accede to part of Richardson\\'s plea: the\\noriginality which secured his immortality was connected, whether\\nby accident or design, with his neglect of established literary\\nmodels in favour of his own vivid awareness of life, and the\\nunconventional but peculiarly appropriate methods which\\nenabled him to express it directly and naturally.\\nIII\\nUnlike Defoe and Richardson, Fielding was steeped in the\\nclassical tradition, and though he was by no means a slavish\\nsupporter of the Rules, he felt strongly that the growing anarchy\\nof literary taste called for drastic measures. In the Covent\\nGarden Journal, for example, he proposed that \\'No author is to\\nbe admitted into the Order of Critics, until he hath read over, and\\nunderstood, Aristotle, Horace, and Longinus, in their original\\nLanguage\\'. 2 Similar qualifications, he felt, were particularly\\nnecessary to preserve the new realm of fiction against what\\nGeorge Eliot once eloquently described as \\'the intrusions of mere\\nleft-handed imbecility\\'; \\'a good share of learning\\', he suggested\\nin Tom Jones, was an essential prerequisite for those who wished\\nto write \\'such histories as these\\', 3 and such learning was\\nundoubtedly intended to include a knowledge of Latin and Greek.\\nIt is therefore wholly in keeping with his general outlook that in\\nJoseph Andrews ( 1742), his first work in the novel genre,\\nFielding should have been at pains to justify his enterprise both\\nto himself and to his literary peers by bringing it into line with\\nthe classical critical tradition. Nor could there be much doubt as\\nto what direction such a justification should take. Many previous\\nwriters and critics of fiction, notably of the seventeenthcentury\\nFrench romances, had assumed that any imitation of\\n____________________\\n1 Y oung, Works ( 1773), V, 94.\\n2 N o. 3 ( 1752).\\nBk. IX, ch. 1.\\n-248-\\n253\\nhuman life in narrative form ought to be assimilated as far as\\npossible to the rules that had been laid down for the epic by\\nAristotle and his innumerable interpreters; and Fieldingapparently\\nquite independently -- started from the same point of\\nview. 1\\nHe began his Preface by suggesting, somewhat patronisingly\\nperhaps, that \\'As it is possible the mere English reader may have\\na different idea of romance from the author of these little\\nvolumes... it may not be improper to premise a few words\\nconcerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to have\\nseen hitherto attempted in our language\\'. He then continued:\\nThe Epic, as well as the Drama, is divided into tragedy and\\ncomedy. Homer, who was the father of this species of poetry,\\ngave us a pattern of both these, though that of the latter kind is\\nentirely lost; which Aristotle tells us, bore the same relation to\\ncomedy which his Iliad bears to tragedy. . . .\\nAnd farther, as this poetry may be tragic or comic, I will not\\nscruple to say it may be likewise either in verse or prose; for\\nthough it wants one particular, which the critic enumerates in the\\nconstituent parts of an epic poem, namely metre; yet, when any\\nkind of writing contains all its other parts, such as fable, action,\\ncharacters, sentiments, and diction, and is deficient in metre\\nonly; it seems, I think, reasonable to refer it to the epic; at least\\nas no critic hath thought proper to range it under any other\\nhead, or to assign it a particular name to itself.\\nFielding\\'s argument here for \\'referring\\' his novel to the epic\\ngenre is unimpressive: Joseph Andrews, no doubt, has five out of\\nthe six parts under which Aristotle considered epic; but then it is\\nsurely impossible to conceive of any narrative whatever which\\ndoes not in some way contain \\'fable, action, characters,\\nsentiments, and diction\\'.\\nThe possession of these five elements certainly does nothing to\\nelucidate the distinction which Fielding goes on to make between\\nthe prose epic and French romances:\\nThus the Telemachus of the archbishop of Cambray appears to\\nme of the epic kind, as well as the Odyssey of Homer; indeed, it\\nis much fairer and more reasonable to give it a name common\\nwith that species from which it differs only in a single\\ninstance,____________________\\n1 S ee René Bray, La Formation de la doctrine classique en\\nFrance ( Paris, 1927), pp. 347-349; Arthur L.

It\\nis not surprising, therefore, that when Fielding goes on to\\ndistinguish his own \\'comic epic in prose\\' from serious epic and its\\nprose analogues he makes no use of this criterion either; instead\\nhe applies the Aristotelian distinction between the serious and\\nthe comic modes in a way that would actually put all the French\\nromances in the same category as the Odyssey and Télémaque:\\nNow a comic romance is a comic epic poem in prose; differing\\nfrom comedy, as the serious epic from tragedy: its action being\\nmore extended and comprehensive; containing a much larger\\ncircle of incidents, and introducing a greater variety of\\ncharacters. It differs from the serious romance in its fable and\\naction, in this; that as in the one these are grave and solemn, so\\nin the other they are light and ridiculous; it differs in its\\ncharacters, by introducing persons of inferior... manners,\\nwhereas the grave romance sets the highest before us; lastly, in\\nits sentiments and diction, by preserving the ludicrous instead of\\nthe sublime.\\nThis completes Fielding\\'s critical exposition of the epic analogy in\\nthe Preface to Joseph Andrews. It is obvious that the whole\\noperative force of the argument depends on the term comic, and\\nthe remainder of the preface, comprising some five-sixths of the\\ntotal, is engaged in developing his ideas of \\'the ludicrous\\'. This,\\nof course, is inevitably accompanied by the dropping of the epic\\nanalogy; for, since Homer\\'s Margites was lost, and the comic epic\\nreceived but a bare mention in the Poetics, Fielding\\'s attempts to\\nbring his novel into line with classical doctrine could not be\\nsupported either by existing literary parallel or theoretical\\nprecedent.\\n255\\nBefore considering the practical effects of the epic analogy on the\\nnovels, it should perhaps be pointed out that what has been\\n-250-\\nreproduced above constitutes almost everything that Fielding\\nsaid about the comic epic in prose. Joseph Andrews was a\\nhurriedly composed work of somewhat mixed intentions, begun\\nas a parody of Pamela and continued in the spirit of Cervantes;\\nand this perhaps suggests that not too much importance should\\nbe attached to its Preface, which does not really adumbrate a\\nwhole theory of fiction; it merely, as Fielding himself says,\\ncontains \\'some few very short hints\\'. The formula of \\'the comic\\nepic poem in prose\\' is only such a hint; and although Fielding\\nreferred to it briefly in his preface to his sister Sarah\\'s David\\nSimple ( 1744), and subsequently called Tom Jones ( 1749) a\\n\\'heroic, historical, prosaic poem\\' and a specimen of \\'prosai-comiepic\\nwriting\\', 1 he did not develop or modify his early formula in\\nhis later writings; indeed, he paid very little further attention to\\nit.\\nIV\\nSince it was a comic variant of epic that Fielding wished to\\nproduce he was debarred from imitating two at least of its\\ncomponent parts -- characters and sentiments; heroic persons\\nand sublime thoughts obviously had no place in Joseph Andrews\\nor Tom Jones. Some aspects of epic plot could, however, be\\nadapted to his purpose, and epic diction could be used in\\nburlesque form.\\nEven as regards plot, it is true, the differences were bound to be\\nmore marked than the similarities: comic characters could hardly\\nbe allowed to perform heroic acts, and whereas epic plots were\\nbased on history or legend, Fielding had to invent his stories. The\\nmost that he could do, therefore, was to retain some other\\ngeneral features of the epic plot while altering the content. The\\nbest example of this is probably Tom Jones, whose action has\\nepic quality at least in the sense that it presents a sweeping\\npanorama of a whole society, as opposed to Richardson\\'s\\n____________________\\n1 B k. IV, ch. 1; Bk. V, ch. 1. It is interesting, incidentally, to\\nobserve that these references occur early; after the first six\\nbooks of Tom Jones Fielding changes over to a more\\ncompletely dramatic method, as W. L. Cross points out (\\nHistory of Henry Fielding, II, 179). Further evidence for\\n256\\nbelieving that Fielding did not take the epic analogy seriously\\nenough to explore the critical issues fully is afforded by the fact\\nthat he took no account either of Aristotle\\'s mention of the\\nform of literature which represented men \\'as they are in real\\nlife\\' (Poetics, ch. 2), which would presumably be the category\\ninto which Amelia at least would fall, or of the contemporary\\ncontroversy as to whether an \\'epic in prose\\' was not a\\ncontradiction in terms (see H. T. Swedenberg , The Theory of\\nthe Epic in England, 1650-1800 ( Berkeley and Los Angeles,\\n1944), pp. 155, 158-159).\\n-251-\\ndetailed picture of a very small social group.\\nBut although the magnitude and variety of the structure of Tom\\nJones fit in very well with the chief connotation of the term \\'epic\\'\\ntoday, it is, after all, mainly a question of scale, and it cannot be\\nheld as evidence of any specific indebtedness on Fielding\\'s part\\nto an epic prototype. There are, however, at least two other\\nmore definite ways in which Fielding transposed characteristic\\nfeatures of the epic plot into a comic context: his use of surprise,\\nand his introduction of mock-heroic battles.\\nIt was generally agreed in neo-classical theory that the action of\\nepic was characterised by two elements -- verisimilitude and the\\nmarvellous: the ways in which these incongruous bedfellows\\ncould be happily mated had taxed all the ingenuity of the\\nRenaissance critics, and their somewhat sophistic arguments had\\nlater been retailed by many of the French writers of romance.\\nFielding attacked the problem in the introductory chapter to the\\neighth book of Tom Jones. He began by excusing the incredible\\nepisodes in Homer on the grounds that he \\'wrote to heathens, to\\nwhom poetical fables were articles of faith\\'; even so, Fielding\\ncould not refrain from wishing that Homer could have known and\\nobeyed Horace\\'s rule prescribing that supernatural agents be\\nintroduced \\'as little as possible\\'. In any case, Fielding proceeded,\\nwriters of epic and genuine historians were able to introduce\\nunlikely events much more plausibly than novelists, since they\\nrecorded \\'public transactions\\' which were already known,\\nwhereas \\'we who deal in private character . . . have no public\\nnotoriety, no concurrent testimony, no records to support and\\ncorroborate what we deliver\\'. He concluded that it \\'becomes\\' the\\nnovelist \\'to keep within the limits not only of possibility, but of\\nprobability too\\'.\\nFielding, then, prescribed a greater emphasis on verisimilitude\\n257\\nfor the new genre than that current in epic or romance. He\\nqualified this, however, by admitting that since \\'the great art of\\npoetry is to mix truth with fiction, in order to join the credible\\nwith the surprising\\', \\'complaisance to the scepticism of the\\nreader\\' should not be taken to a point at which the only\\ncharacters or incidents permitted are \\'trite, common, or vulgar;\\nsuch as may happen in every street, or in every house, or which\\nmay be met with in the home articles of a newspaper\\'.\\nWhat Fielding actually means by \\'the surprising\\' is made clear by\\nthe context: he is referring primarily to the series of\\n-252-\\ncoincidences whereby Tom Jones successively meets the beggar\\nwho has picked up Sophia\\'s pocket-book, the Merry Andrew who\\nhas seen her pass along the road, and her actual guide for part\\nof the route; more generally, to the way that hero and heroine\\ncontinually cross each other\\'s path on their journey to London\\nwithout ever meeting. Fielding valued such devices because they\\nmade it possible to weave the whole narrative into a very neat\\nand entertaining formal structure; but although such apposite\\njuxtapositions of persons and events do not violate verisimilitude\\nso obviously as the supernatural interventions that are common\\nin Homer or Virgil, it is surely evident that they nevertheless\\ntend to compromise the narrative\\'s general air of literal\\nauthenticity by suggesting the manipulated sequences of\\nliterature rather than the ordinary processes of life. Thus even\\nFielding\\'s relatively inconspicuous concessions to the doctrine of\\nthe marvellous tended to confirm, as far as the novel was\\nconcerned, the reality of the dilemma of the would-be writer of\\nepic in modern times which Blackwell had stated in his Enquiry:\\n\\'The marvellous and wonderful is the nerve of the epic strain: but\\nwhat marvellous things happen in a well ordered state? We can\\nhardly be surprised.\\' 1\\nFielding\\'s most obvious imitation of the epic model in the action\\nof his novels -- the mock-heroic battles -- is also somewhat at\\nvariance both with the dictates of formal realism and with the life\\nof his time. Either because the events themselves are inherently\\nimprobable -- as is the case, for instance, with the fight between\\nJoseph Andrews and the pack of hounds that is pursuing Parson\\nAdams 2 -- or because they are narrated in such a way as to\\ndeflect our attention from the events themselves to the way that\\nFielding is handling them and to epic parallels involved. This is\\nactually the case in the episode from Joseph Andrews, and it is\\neven more obviously so in Moll Seagrim\\'s celebrated churchyard\\n258\\nbattle in Tom Jones. 3 The spectacle of a village mob assaulting a\\npregnant girl after church service is in itself anything but\\namusing, and only Fielding\\'s burlesque manner, his \\'Homerican\\nstyle\\', enables him to maintain the comic note. It is certain that\\nthis and some other episodes would be quite unacceptable if\\nFielding directed our attention wholly to the actions and feelings\\nof the participants; and, even so, it may be\\n____________________\\n1 P . 26.\\n2 J oseph Andrews, Bk. III, ch. 6.\\n3 T om Jones, Bk. V, ch. 8.\\n-253-\\ndoubted whether the Moll Seagrim scene, at least, coming from\\nso humane a man as Fielding, does not give some colour to\\nRichardson\\'s objections to the bellicose influence of epic.\\nFielding\\'s Homerican style itself suggests a somewhat ambiguous\\nattitude to the epic model: were it not for the Preface we would\\nsurely be justified in taking Joseph Andrews as a parody of epic\\nprocedures rather than as the work of a writer who planned to\\nuse them as a basis for the new genre: and even if we take\\naccount of the Preface, Fielding\\'s novel surely reflects the\\nambiguous attitude of his age, an age whose characteristic\\nliterary emphasis on the mock-heroic reveals how far it was from\\nthe epic world it so much admired.\\nThe reasons for this ambivalence, indeed, are evident in the\\nPreface to Joseph Andrews, where Fielding by implication admits\\nthat the direct imitation of the epic was in opposition to the\\nimitation of \\'nature\\' when he states that although he has allowed\\n\\'parodies or burlesque imitations\\' in his diction, chiefly for the\\n\\'entertainment\\' of \\'the classical reader\\', he has \\'carefully\\nexcluded\\' them from his sentiments and characters because it is\\nhis major intention to confine himself \\'strictly to nature, from the\\njust imitation of which will flow all the pleasure we can... convey\\nto the sensible reader\\'. The difficulty with such a dual attitude, of\\ncourse, is that, as a good Aristotelian like Fielding must have\\nknown, no single component of a literary work can in fact be\\ntreated as an independent entity. He argues in Tom Jones, for\\nexample, that without \\'sundry similes, descriptions, and other\\nkind of poetical embellishments the best narrative of plain matter\\nof fact must overpower every reader\\'; but when he goes on to\\ninform us that the introduction of the heroine requires \\'the\\nutmost solemnity in our power, with an elevation of style, and all\\n259\\nother circumstance proper to raise the veneration of our reader\\',\\n1 and follows this with a chapter entitled \\'A Short Hint of what we\\ncan do in the Sublime, and a Description of Miss Sophia\\nWestern\\', which begins: \\'Hushed be every ruder breath. May the\\nheathen ruler of the winds confine in iron chains the boisterous\\nlimbs of noisy Boreas\\' -- it is surely evident that Fielding has\\nachieved his \\'poetical embellishment\\' at a very considerable\\nprice: Sophia never wholly recovers from so artificial an\\nintroduction, or at least never\\n____________________\\n1 Bk. IV, ch. 1.\\n-254-\\nwholly disengages herself from the ironical attitude which it has\\ninduced.\\nA similar diminution of the reader\\'s belief in the authenticity of\\nthe character or the action occurs whenever the usual tenor of\\nFielding\\'s narrative is interrupted by the stylistic devices of epic;\\nthis surely underlines the fact that the conventions of formal\\nrealism compose an inseparable whole, of which the linguistic\\none is an integral part; or, as one of his contemporaries, Lord\\nMonboddo, put it, Fielding\\'s abandonment of his \\'simple and\\nfamiliar\\' style impaired \\'the probability of the narrative, which\\nought to be carefully studied in all... imitations of real life and\\nmanners\\'. 1\\nV\\nFielding\\'s last novel, Amelia ( 1751), is wholly serious in moral\\npurpose and narrative manner; and its allegiance to the epic\\nmodel is of a very different kind. There is no reference to the\\nformula of the comic epic in prose, and both mock-heroic\\nincidents and epic diction have been abandoned; in their place,\\nas Fielding announced in the Covent Garden Journal, Virgil\\'s\\nAeneid \\'was the noble model, which I have made use of on this\\noccasion\\'. 2 Booth also is an unemployed soldier, the episode in\\nNewgate with Miss Matthews refers to the loves of Aeneas and\\nDido in the cave, and there are some other slight parallels which\\nhave been outlined by George Sherburn. 3\\nIt will be noted that this kind of analogy involves no more than a\\nkind of narrative metaphor which assists the imagination of the\\nwriter to find a pattern for his own observation of life without in\\nany way detracting from the novel\\'s appearance of literal\\n261\\nveracity: nor does the reader need to know about the analogy to\\nappreciate Amelia, as he does with the burlesque passages in\\nFielding\\'s earlier novels. For these reasons Amelia may be\\nregarded as the work in which the influence of the epic on\\nFielding was most fruitful; and it is certainly here that he had his\\nmost illustrious successor. When T. S. Eliot, with that leap into\\nhyperbole which seems mandatory whenever the relation of\\nnovel and epic is being mooted, writes that James Joyce\\'s use of\\nthe epic parallel in Ulysses \\'has the importance of\\n____________________\\n1 O f the Origin and Progress of Language ( Edinburgh, 1776),\\nIII, 296-298.\\n2 N o. 8 ( 1752).\\n3 \" Fielding\\'s Amelia: An Interpretation\", ELH, III ( 1936), 3-4.\\n-255-\\na scientific discovery\\', 1 and claims that \\'no one else has built a\\nnovel upon such a foundation before\\', he is surely being distinctly\\nunfair to Fielding\\'s no doubt fragmentary application of a similar\\nidea.\\nAfter Amelia, Fielding continued to move away from his earlier\\nliterary outlook. He came to see the insufficiency of his early\\nviews of affectation as the only source of the ridiculous, and\\ntherefore of comedy, and his increasingly serious moral outlook\\neven made him find much to regret in two of his early comic\\nfavourites, Aristophanes and Rabelais. 2 At the same time his\\nattitude towards epic changed, a change whose climax comes in\\nthe Preface to The Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon:\\nBut, in reality, the Odyssey, the Telemachus, and all of that kind,\\nare to the voyage-writing I here intend, what romance is to true\\nhistory, the former being the confounder and corrupter of the\\nlatter. I am far from supposing that Homer, Hesiod, and the\\nother ancient poets and mythologists, had any settled design to\\npervert and confuse the records of antiquity; but it is certain that\\nthey have effected it; and for my part I must confess that I\\nshould have honoured and loved Homer more had he written a\\ntrue history of his own times in humble prose, than those noble\\npoems that have so justly collected the praise of all ages; for,\\nthough I read these with more admiration and astonishment, I\\nstill read Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon with more\\namusement and more satisfaction.\\nThe statement must be taken in its context. The Odyssey is\\n261\\nobviously an unsatisfactory model for an account of an\\neighteenthcentury voyage to Lisbon. Still, to couple Télémaque\\nand the Odyssey as romances, represents a total reversal of\\nFielding\\'s position in Joseph Andrews. The contrast between both\\nof them, on the one hand, and \\'true history\\' on the other is also\\ntaken far beyond what was needed for a prefatory explanation of\\nthe type of writing which he was proposing to follow; and\\nFielding comes very close to Defoe\\'s position when he speaks of\\nthe way that Homer and the other \\'original poets\\' corrupted\\nhistorical truth. The reason he gives for their doing so is an\\ninteresting one: \\'they found the limits of nature too straight for\\nthe immensity of their genius, which they had not room to exert\\nwithout\\n____________________\\n1 \" Ulysses, Order and Myth\", Dial, 1923; quoted from Forms of\\nModern Fiction, ed.

Amelia is, as has often been said, much closer to\\nRichardson\\'s close study of domestic life than his previous works;\\nand although Fielding did not live long enough to embody his\\nreorientation in another novel, there seems to be no doubt that\\nhe had become conscious of the fact that his earlier applications\\nof the epic analogy had been responsible for his most obvious\\ndivergences from the role proper to the faithful historian of the\\nlife of his time -- a realisation, incidentally, which is implicit in his\\nironical defence of the epic diction in Tom Jones which was\\nintroduced, he explained, so that it \\'might be in no danger of\\nbeing likened to the labours of [modern] historians\\'. 1\\nAt the same time the extent of the influence of the epic analogy\\non Fielding\\'s earlier novels must not be exaggerated. He called\\nTom Jones \\'A History\\', and habitually described his role as that of\\nhistorian or biographer whose function was to give a faithful\\n262\\npresentation of the life of his time. Fielding\\'s conception of this\\nrole, it is true, was different from that of Defoe or Richardson,\\nbut the difference is mainly connected, not with his attempt to\\nimitate epic, but with the general influence of the neo-classical\\ntradition on every aspect of his work. The most specific literary\\ndebt manifested in Tom Jones, indeed, is not to epic but to\\ndrama: not so much because his main critical source, Aristotle\\'s\\nPoetics, was primarily concerned with drama and gave epic a\\nsecondary place, as because Fielding had been a dramatist\\nhimself for over a decade before attempting fiction. The\\nremarkable coherence of the plot of Tom Jones surely owes little\\nto the actual example of Homer or Virgil, and little more to\\nAristotle\\'s insistence that \\'in the Epic as in Tragedy, the story\\nshould be constructed on dramatic principles\\'; 2 it is very\\n____________________\\n1 B k.

It is also highly likely, incidentally, that some of the\\nother features of his novels, such as the coincidences and\\ndiscoveries which provide surprise at the cost of a certain loss of\\nauthenticity, are also a legacy from the drama rather than from\\nthe epic; and even the burlesque and mock-heroic elements had\\nappeared long ago in many of his plays, such as Tom Thumb, a\\nTragedy ( 1730).\\nWhy, then, it may be asked, has the formula of the comic epic in\\nprose so \\'obsessed critics of novels\\', to use George Sherburn\\'s\\nphrase? 1 It no doubt makes an immediate appeal to those who,\\nlike Peacock\\'s Dr. Folliott, habitually manifest \\'a safe and peculiar\\ninaccessibility to ideas except such as are recommended by an\\nalmost artless simplicity or a classical origin\\'; 2 and this perhaps\\ngives a clue both to the reason why Fielding was led to invent\\nthe formula and to why it later flourished.\\nIn 1742 the novel was a form in grave disrepute, and Fielding\\nprobably felt that to enlist the prestige of epic might help win for\\nhis first essay in the genre a less prejudiced hearing from the\\nliterati than might otherwise have been expected. In this Fielding\\nwas actually following the example of the French writers of\\nromance a century earlier; they, too, had laid claim to the epic\\n263\\nfiliation in prefatory asseverations which were not so much\\naccurate analyses of their achievement as attempts to assuage\\ntheir own anxieties and those of their readers about the\\nuncanonised nature of what was to follow in the text. Nor have\\nsuch attempts to dissipate the odour of unsanctity in which prose\\nfiction seems destined to have its being ceased even in our day -\\n- F. R. Leavis\\'s \\'The Novel as Dramatic Poem\\' would seem to be\\nan analogous attempt to smuggle the novel into the critical\\nPantheon under the disguise of an ancient and honoured\\nmember.\\nAt the same time, however, the fact that the formulae both of\\nFielding and of Leavis connect the novel with major poetic forms\\nsuggests an effort to put the genre into the highest possible\\nliterary context. Obviously both the creation and the criticism of\\nthe novel cannot but gain from this, and it is indeed likely that\\nthe most positive gain which Fielding derived from thinking about\\nhis narrative in terms of epic was that it encouraged him\\n____________________\\n1 F ielding Amelia, p. 2.\\n2 C arl van Doren, Life of Thomas Love Peacock ( London, 1911),\\np. 194.\\n-258-\\nto as intense and serious a travail as the loftiest literary forms\\nwere presumed to demand.\\nApart from this it is likely that the epic influence on Fielding was\\nvery slight, mainly retrograde, and of little importance in the\\nlater tradition of the novel. To call Fielding, as Ethel Thornbury\\ndoes in her monograph on the subject, \\'the founder of the\\nEnglish Prose epic\\' 1 is surely to award him a somewhat sterile\\npaternity; Fielding\\'s greatest followers, Smollett, Dickens and\\nThackeray, do not, for example, imitate the very few specifically\\nepic features in his work. But, as we have seen, the idea of \\'the\\ncomic epic in prose\\' is by no means Fielding\\'s major claim on our\\nattention: its main function was to suggest one of the high\\nstandards of literary achievement which he wished to keep in\\nmind when he began on his new path in fiction; it was certainly\\nnot intended as yet another of the innumerable eighteenthcentury\\n\\'Receits to make an Epick Poem\\'; and this is fortunate,\\nfor, in literature at least, the nostrum killeth but the nostalgia\\nmay give life.\\n____________________\\n264\\n1 H enry Fielding\\'s Theory of the Comic Prose Epic.

This distinction between\\nRichardson and Fielding was more memorably expressed when\\nJohnson said that \\'there was as great a difference between them\\nas between a man who knew how a watch was made, and a man\\nwho could tell the hour by looking on the dial plate\\'; 1 and the\\nsame idea is present in the even more plainly invidious\\nstatement reported by Mrs. Thrale that \\' Richardson had picked\\nthe kernel of life... while Fielding was contented with the husk\\'. 2\\nThis basic distinction does not involve any direct divergence from\\ncritical orthodoxy, but it perhaps does so implicitly, since the\\nbasis of Richardson\\'s \\'diving into the recesses of the human\\nheart\\' was his detailed description of individual states of mind, a\\ndescription which requires a minute particularity in the\\npresentation of character, and which is therefore contrary to the\\nusual neo-classical bias towards the general and the universal.\\nThere is no doubt that Johnson\\'s theoretical presuppositions were\\nstrongly in this direction, as he often proclaimed the doctrine\\nthat the poet \\'must not dwell on the minuter distinctions by\\nwhich one species differs from another\\'. 3 Yet his operative\\npremises for fiction were apparently quite different, since he\\nreproached Fielding for his reluctance to dwell on these very\\ndistinctions, telling Mrs. Thrale, for example, that \\' Fielding could\\ndescribe a horse or an ass, but he never reached to a mule\\'. 4\\nIt would seem, then, that Johnson\\'s vigorously independent\\nliterary sensibility tended to confirm at least one of the elements\\nof the opposition described in the first chapter between\\nneoclassical theory and the novel\\'s formal realism. As for the\\ndiscrepancy between Johnson\\'s literary theory and his practical\\njudgement, it need occasion little surprise: any body of doctrine\\nis ambiguous in some of its applications, and especially when it\\n____________________\\n266\\n1 L ife of Johnson, ed.

Balderston, I, 555.\\n-261-\\nis applied in areas for which it was not originally designed. In any\\ncase, Johnson\\'s neo-classicism was not a simple thing (neither,\\nfor that matter, was neo-classicism); and his divergence from his\\nusual principles in the present instance must surely be regarded\\nas yet another example of how the radical honesty of his literary\\ninsight raised fundamental issues so forcibly that later criticism\\ncannot but use his formulations as points of departure; any\\ncomparison between the two first masters of the novel form\\ncertainly must begin from the basis which he provided.\\nI\\nTom Jones and Clarissa have sufficient similarity of theme to\\nprovide several closely parallel scenes which afford a concrete\\nillustration of the differences between the methods of Fielding\\nand Richardson as novelists. Both, for example, show us scenes\\nwhere the heroine is forced to receive the addresses of the hated\\nsuitor their parents have chosen for them, and both also portray\\nthe later conflict between father and daughter which their refusal\\nto marry this suitor provokes.\\nHere, first, is how Fielding describes the interview between\\nSophia Western and the odious Blifil:\\nMr. Blifil soon arrived; and Mr. Western soon after withdrawing,\\nleft the young couple together.\\nHere a long silence of near a quarter of an hour ensued; for the\\ngentleman, who was to begin the conversation, had all that\\nunbecoming modesty which consists in bashfulness. He often\\nattempted to speak, and as often suppressed his words just at\\nthe very point of utterance. At last, out they broke in a torrent of\\nfarfetched and high-strained compliments, which were answered\\non her side by downcast looks, half bows, and civil\\nmonosyllables. -Blifil, from his inexperience in the ways of\\nwomen, and from his conceit of himself, took this behaviour for a\\nmodest assent to his courtship; and when, to shorten a scene\\nwhich she could no longer support, Sophia rose up and left the\\nroom, he imputed that, too, merely to bashfulness, and\\ncomforted himself that he should soon have enough of her\\n267\\ncompany.\\nHe was indeed perfectly well satisfied with his prospect of\\nsuccess; for as to that entire and absolute possession of the\\nheart of his mistress, which romantic lovers require, the very\\nidea of it never entered his head. Her fortune and her person\\nwere the\\n-262-\\nsole objects of his wishes, of which he made no doubt soon to\\nobtain the absolute property; as Mr. Western\\'s mind was so\\nearnestly bent on the match; and as he well knew the strict\\nobedience which Sophia was always ready to pay to her father\\'s\\nwill, and the greater still which her father would exact, if there\\nwas occasion... 1\\nStructurally, the scene is based on that typical device of comedy,\\ntotal ignorance by one character of the intentions of the other as\\na result of a misunderstanding between third parties -- Squire\\nWestern has been misled by the ineffable Mistress Western into\\nthinking that Sophia loves Blifil, not Tom Jones. It is perhaps\\nbecause this misunderstanding must be kept up that there is no\\nactual conversation and little feeling of personal contact between\\nthe characters concerned. Instead, Fielding, acting as omniscient\\nauthor, lets us into Blifil\\'s mind, and the meanness of the\\nconsiderations by which it is governed: at the same time the\\nconsistent irony of Fielding\\'s tone suggests to us the probable\\nlimits of Blifil\\'s role: we need not fear that he will ever get\\npossession of Sophia\\'s fortune or of her person, for, although he\\nis cast as a villain, it is patently as the villain in comedy.\\nBlifil\\'s misunderstanding of Sophia\\'s silence leads on to the next\\ncomic complication, since it causes him to give Squire Western\\nthe impression that his suit has prospered. Western at once goes\\nto rejoice with his daughter, who of course is unaware of how he\\nhas been deceived:\\nSophia, perceiving her father in this fit of affection, which she did\\nnot absolutely know the reason of (for fits of fondness were not\\nunusual in him, though this was rather more violent than\\nordinary), thought she should never have a better second\\nopportunity of disclosing herself than at present, as far at least\\nas regarded Mr. Blifil; and she too well foresaw the necessity\\nwhich she should soon be under of coming to a full explanation.\\nAfter having thanked the squire, therefore, for all his professions\\nof kindness, she added with a look full of inexpressible softness,\\n268\\n\\'And is it possible that my papa can be so good as to place all his\\njoy in his Sophy\\'s happiness?\\' which Western having confirmed\\nby a great oath and a kiss, she then laid hold of his hand, and\\nfalling on her knees, after many warm and passionate\\ndeclarations of affection and duty, she begged him \\'not to make\\nher the most miserable creature on earth, by forcing her to\\nmarry a man she detested. This I\\n____________________\\nBk. VI, ch. 7.\\n-263-\\nentreat of you, dear sir,\\' said she, \\'for your sake, as well as my\\nown, since you are so very kind to tell me your happiness depends\\non mine.\\' -- \\'How! What! says Western, staring wildly. \\'O, sir,\\'\\ncontinued she, \\'not only your poor Sophy\\'s happiness, her very life,\\nher being, depends upon your granting her request. I cannot live\\nwith Mr. Blifil. To force me into this marriage would be killing me.\\' --\\n\\'You can\\'t live with Mr. Blifil!\\' says Mr. Western -- \\'No, upon my\\nsoul, I can\\'t,\\' answered Sophia. -- \\'Then die and be d -- ned,\\' cries\\nhe, spurning her from him... \\'I am resolved upon the match, and\\nunless you consent to it, I will not give you a groat, not a single\\nfarthing; no, though I saw you expiring in the street, I would not\\nrelieve you with a morsel of bread. This is my fixed resolution, and\\nso I leave you to consider on it.\\' He then broke from her with such\\nviolence, that her face dashed against the floor; and he burst\\ndirectly out of the room, leaving poor Sophia prostrate on the\\nground.\\nFielding\\'s primary aim is certainly not to reveal character through\\nspeech and action. We cannot be meant to deduce, for instance,\\nthat Sophia knows her father so poorly as to entertain any hopes of\\nbeing able to hold him down to one position by force of logic; what\\nFielding tells us about Sophia\\'s decision to break the matter to her\\nfather is obviously mainly aimed at heightening the comic reversal\\nthat is to follow. Similarly we cannot consider Western\\'s threat --\\n\\'No, though I saw you expiring in the street, I would not relieve you\\nwith a morsel of bread\\' -- as characteristic of the man either in\\ndiction or sentiment -- it is hackneyed trope that belongs to any\\nsuch situation in melodrama, not to a particular Squire who\\nhabitually speaks the most uncouth Somersetshire jargon, and\\nwhose childish intemperateness is not elsewhere shown capable of\\nsuch an imaginative flight. To say that Sophia\\'s and Western\\'s\\nspeeches are grossly out of character would be an exaggeration;\\nbut they are undoubtedly directed entirely towards exploiting the\\ncomic volte-face and not towards making us witnesses of an actual\\ninterview between a father and daughter in real life.\\n269\\nIt is probably an essential condition for the realisation of Fielding\\'s\\ncomic aim that the scene should not be rendered in all its physical\\nand psychological detail; Fielding must temper our alarm for\\nSophia\\'s fate by assuring us that we are witnessing, not real\\nanguish, but that conventional kind of comic perplexity which serves\\nto heighten our eventual pleasure at the happy\\n-264-\\nending, without in the meantime involving any unnecessary\\nexpenditure of tears on our part. Fielding\\'s external and\\nsomewhat peremptory approach to his characters, in fact, would\\nseem to be a necessary condition of the success of his main\\ncomic purpose: attention to the immediate counterpoint of\\nmisunderstanding and contradiction must not be dissipated by\\nfocussing interest on Sophia\\'s feelings or on any other tangential\\nissue.\\nA total contrast of purpose and method is offered by the way\\nRichardson presents Clarissa\\'s interview with Solmes, after her\\nmaid Hannah has warned her secretly that he is the husband\\nthat has been decided on for her. It is thus described in a letter\\nto Anna Howe:\\nI went down this morning when breakfast was ready with a very\\nuneasy heart... wishing for an opportunity to appeal to my\\nmother, in hopes to engage her interest in my behalf, and\\npurposing to try to find one when she retired to her own\\napartment after breakfast; but, unluckily, there was the odious\\nSolmes sitting asquat between my mother and sister, with so\\nmuch assurance in his looks! But you know, my dear, that those\\nwe love not cannot do anything to please us.\\nHad the wretch kept his seat, it might have been well enough:\\nbut the bent and broad-shouldered creature must needs rise and\\nstalk towards a chair; which was just by that which was set for\\nme.\\nI removed it to a distance, as if to make way to my own: And\\ndown I sat, abruptly I believe; what I had heard all in my head.\\nBut this was not enough to daunt him. The man is a very\\nconfident, he is a very bold, staring man! Indeed, my dear, the\\nman is very confident!\\nHe took the removed chair and drew it so near mine, squatting in\\nit with his ugly weight, that he pressed upon my hoop. I was so\\n271\\noffended (all I had heard, as I said, in my head) that I removed\\nto another chair. I own I had too little command of myself. It\\ngave my brother and sister too much advantage. I dare say they\\ntook it. But I did it involuntarily, I think. I could not help it. I\\nknew not what I did.\\nI saw that my father was excessively displeased. When angry, no\\nman\\'s countenance ever shows it so much as my father\\'s.\\nClarissa Harlowe! said he with a big voice -- and there he\\nstopped. Sir! said I, trembling and curtsying (for I had not then\\nsat down again): and put my chair nearer the wretch, and sat\\ndown -- my face, as I could feel, all in a glow.\\n-265-\\nMake tea, child, said my kind mamma: sit by me, love, and\\nmake tea.\\nI removed with pleasure to the seat the man had quitted; and\\nbeing thus indulgently put into employment, soon recovered\\nmyself; and in the course of the breakfasting officiously asked\\ntwo or three questions of Mr. Solmes, which I would not have\\ndone, but to make up with my father. Proud spirits may be\\nbrought to! whisperingly spoke my sister to me over her\\nshoulder, with an air of triumph and scorn: but I did not mind\\nher.\\nMy mother was all kindness and condescension. I asked her once\\nif she were pleased with the tea...\\nSmall incidents these, my dear, to trouble you with; only as they\\nlead to greater, as you shall hear.\\nBefore the usual breakfast-time was over my father withdrew\\nwith my mother, telling her he wanted to speak to her. Then my\\nsister and next my aunt (who was with us) dropped away.\\nMy brother gave himself some airs of insult, which I understood\\nwell enough; but which Mr. Solmes could make nothing of: and\\nat last he arose from his seat. Sister, says he, I have a curiosity\\nto show you. I will fetch it. And away he went; shutting the door\\nclose after him.\\nI saw what all this was for. I arose; the man hemming up for a\\nspeech, rising and beginning to set his splay feet (indeed, my\\ndear, the man in all his ways is hateful to me!) in an approaching\\nposture. I will save my brother the trouble of bringing to me his\\n271\\ncuriosity, said I. I curtsied -- your servant, sir. The man cried,\\nmadam, madam, twice, and looked like a fool. But away I went -\\nto find my brother to save my word. But my brother, indifferent\\nas the weather was, was gone to walk in the garden with my\\nsister. A plain case that he had left his curiosity with me, and\\ndesigned to show me no other. 1\\nThe passage is characteristic of Richardson\\'s very different kind\\nof realism. Clarissa is describing what happened \\'this morning\\',\\nand is \\'as minute as\\' she knows Anna wishes her to be; only so\\ncan Richardson convey the physical reality of the scene -- the\\nparty at breakfast, the jockeying for position over trifles, and all\\nthe ordinarily trivial domestic details which bear the main burden\\nof the drama. The letter form gives Richardson access to\\nthoughts and emotions of a kind that cannot issue in speech, and\\nare hardly capable of rational analysis -- the flux and reflux of\\nClarissa\\'s lacerated sensibility as she struggles\\n____________________\\nI, 68-70.\\n-266-\\nagainst parental tyranny on the battlefield of petty circumstance:\\nas a result we have quite a different kind of participation from\\nthat which Fielding produces: not a lively but objective sense of\\nthe total comic pattern, but a complete identification with the\\nconsciousness of Clarissa while her nerves still quiver from the\\nrecollection of the scene, and her imagination recoils from the\\nthought of her own strained alternation between involuntary\\nrevolt and paralysed compliance.\\nBecause Richardson\\'s narrative sequence is based on an\\nexploration in depth of the protagonist\\'s reaction to experience,\\nit encompasses many minor shades of emotion and character\\nthat are not found in the passages from Tom Jones. Fielding does\\nnot attempt to do more than to make us understand the rational\\ngrounds on which Sophia acts as she does -- there is nothing\\nwhich would not fit almost any sensible young girl\\'s behaviour in\\nthe circumstances: whereas Richardson\\'s epistolary technique,\\nand the intimacy of Clarissa with Anna, encourages him to go far\\nbeyond this, and communicate a host of things which deepen\\nand particularise our picture of Clarissa\\'s total moral being. Her\\nshuddering ejaculation -- \\'Indeed, my dear, the man is very\\nconfident\\', her scornful comment on her sister\\'s intervention -- \\'I\\ndid not mind her\\', and her admission of involvement in petty\\nfamily rivalries -- she regrets moving away from Solmes because\\n272\\n\\'It gave my brother and sister too much advantage\\' -- all these\\ndetails of characterisation must surely be overlooked by those\\nwho describe Richardson as a creator of \\'ideal\\' characters: there\\nis, of course, great will and tenacity in Clarissa, but it is very\\ndefinitely that of an inexperienced young woman, who has her\\nfair share of sisterly vindictiveness and pert selfassertion, and\\nwho, far from being an idealised figure of virgin sainthood, is\\ncapable of the catty and sardonic emphasis on Mr. Solmes as a\\n\\'curiosity\\'. Nor is she by any means a disembodied being; we\\nhave no indications of any physical reaction on Sophia\\'s part\\ntowards Blifil, but we are given Clarissa\\'s very intense one to\\nSolmes -- an instinctive sexual revulsion from \\'his ugly weight\\'.\\nThe same setting of personal relationships in a minutely\\ndescribed physical, psychological and even physiological\\ncontinuum is shown in the brief scene which is the counterpart of\\nthe second passage quoted from Tom Jones. After two private\\ninterviews with her mother, Clarissa has been faced with a\\n-267-\\nfamily ultimatum, and her mother is with her to receive an\\nanswer:\\nJust then, up came my father, with a sternness in his looks that\\nmade me tremble. He took two or three turns about my\\nchamber, though pained by his gout. And then said to my\\nmother, who was silent, as soon as she saw him:\\nMy dear, you are long absent. Dinner is near ready. What you\\nhad to say lay in a very little compass. Surely, you have nothing\\nto do but to declare your will, and my will -- but perhaps you\\nmay be talking of the preparations. Let us soon have you down -\\n- your daughter in your hand, if worthy of the name.\\nAnd down he went, casting his eye upon me with a look so stern\\nthat I was unable to say one word to him, or even for a few\\nminutes to my mother. 1\\nRichardson and Fielding portray the cruelty of the two fathers\\nvery differently; that of Squire Western has an involuntary and\\nexaggerated quality, whereas Mr. Harlowe\\'s is that of ordinary\\nlife; the latter\\'s callous resolve seems all the more convincing\\nbecause it is only manifested in his refusal to speak to Clarissa --\\nour own emotional involvement in the inner world of Clarissa\\nmakes it possible for a father\\'s silent look to have a resonance\\nthat is quite lacking in the physical and rhetorical hyperbole by\\n273\\nwhich Fielding demonstrates the fury of Squire Western.\\nII\\nOn further analysis, then, it appears that Johnson\\'s comparison\\nbetween Richardson and Fielding does not directly raise the\\nquestion of which was the better psychologist, but depends\\nrather on their quite opposite literary intentions: those of\\nFielding allotted characterisation a much less important place in\\nhis total literary structure, and precluded him even from\\nattempting the effects which were suited to Richardson\\'s very\\ndifferent aim. The full implications of the divergence can perhaps\\nbe most clearly and inclusively demonstrated in Fielding\\'s\\nhandling of the plot in Tom Jones, for it reflects the whole of his\\nsocial, moral and literary outlook.\\nFielding\\'s conduct of the action, despite a few excrescences such\\nas the interpolated story of the Man of the Hill, and some\\n____________________\\nI, 75-76.\\n-268-\\nsigns of haste and confusion in the concluding books, 1 exhibits a\\nremarkably fine control over a very complicated structure, and\\nabundantly justifies Coleridge\\'s famous eulogy: \\'What a master\\nof composition Fielding was! Upon my word, I think the Oedipus\\nTyrannus, the Alchemist, and Tom Jones, the three most perfect\\nplots ever planned.\\' 2\\nPerfect for what? we must ask. Not, certainly, for the exploration\\nof character and of personal relations, since in all three plots the\\nemphasis falls on the author\\'s skilfully contrived revelation of an\\nexternal and deterministic scheme: in Oedipus the hero\\'s\\ncharacter is of minor importance compared with the\\nconsequences of his past actions, which were themselves the\\nresult of a prophecy made long before his birth; in the Alchemist\\nthe portrayal of Face and Subtle does not go far beyond the need\\nfor suitable instruments to carry out Jonson\\'s complex series of\\nchicaneries; while the plot of Tom Jones offers a combination of\\nthese features. As in Sophocles, the crucial secret, that of the\\nhero\\'s actual birth, is very elaborately prepared for and hinted at\\nthroughout the action, and its eventual disclosure brings about\\nthe final reordering of all the main issues of the story: while, as\\nin Jonson, this final reordering is achieved through the\\n274\\nunmasking of a complicated pattern of villainy and deception.\\nThe three plots are alike in another respect: their basic direction\\nis towards a return to the norm, and they therefore have a\\nfundamentally static quality. In this they no doubt reflect the\\nconservatism of their authors, a conservatism which in Fielding\\'s\\ncase is probably connected with the fact that he belonged, not to\\nthe trading class like Defoe and Richardson, but to the gentry.\\nThe plots of the novels of Defoe and Richardson, as we have\\nseen, mirrored certain dynamic tendencies in the outlook of their\\nclass: in Moll Flanders, for example, money has a certain\\nautonomous force which determines the action at every turn. In\\nTom Jones, on the other hand, as in the Alchemist, money is\\nsomething that the good characters either have or are given or\\nmomentarily lose: only bad characters devote any effort either to\\ngetting it or keeping it. Money, in fact, is a useful plot device but\\nit has no controlling significance.\\nBirth, on the other hand, has a very different status in Tom\\n____________________\\n1 F or a full account see F.

Blanchard, Fielding, pp. 320-321.\\n-269-\\nJones: as a determining factor in the plot it is almost the\\nequivalent of money in Defoe or virtue in Richardson. In this\\nemphasis, of course, Fielding reflects the general tenor of the\\nsocial thought of his day: the basis of society is and should be a\\nsystem of classes each with their own capacities and\\nresponsibilities. The vigour of Fielding\\'s satire on the upper\\nclasses, for example, should not be interpreted as the expression\\nof any egalitarian tendency: it is really a tribute to the firmness\\nof his belief in the class premise. It is true that in Amelia he goes\\nso far as to say that \\'of all kinds of pride, there is none so\\nunchristian as that of station\\'. 1 But that, of course, is only a\\nmatter of noblesse oblige; and in Tom Jones Fielding also wrote\\nthat \\'liberality of spirits\\' was a quality which he had \\'scarce ever\\nseen in men of low birth and education\\'. 2\\nThis class fixity is an essential part of Tom Jones. Tom may think\\nit unfortunate that, as a foundling of presumed low ancestry, he\\ncannot marry Sophia; but he does not question the propriety of\\nthe assumption on which their separation is decreed. The\\nultimate task of Fielding\\'s plot therefore is to unite the lovers\\n275\\nwithout subverting the basis of the social order; and this can\\nonly be done by revealing that Mr. Jones, though illegitimate, is\\ngenteel. This, however, is not wholly a surprise to the perceptive\\nreader, for whom Tom\\'s eminent \\'liberality of spirit\\' has already\\nsuggested his superior pedigree; the recent Soviet critic,\\ntherefore, who sees the story as the triumph of a proletarian\\nhero 3 is neglecting, not only the facts of his birth, but its\\ncontinuing implications for his character.\\nFielding\\'s conservatism accounts for another and much more\\ngeneral difference between the plots of Tom Jones and Clarissa:\\nfor whereas Richardson depicts the crucifixion of the individual\\nby society, Fielding portrays the successful adaptation of the\\nindividual to society, and this entails a very different relation\\nbetween plot and character.\\nIn Clarissa the individual must be given priority in the total\\nstructure: Richardson merely brings together certain individuals,\\nand their proximity is all that is necessary to set off an extended\\nchain reaction which then proceeds under its own\\n____________________\\nBk.

In Tom Jones, on the other hand, society and the\\nlarger order which it represents must have priority, and the plot\\'s\\nfunction, therefore, is to perform a physical rather than a\\nchemical change: it acts as a kind of magnet that pulls every\\nindividual particle out of the random order brought about by\\ntemporal accident and human imperfection and puts them all\\nback into their proper position. The constitution of the particles\\nthemselves -- the characters -- is not modified in the process,\\nbut the plot serves to reveal something much more important -\\nthe fact that all human particles are subject to an ultimate\\ninvisible force which exists in the universe whether they are\\nthere to show it or not.\\nSuch a plot reflects the general literary strategy of\\nneoclassicism; just as the creation of a field of force makes\\n276\\nvisible the universal laws of magnetism, so the supreme task of\\nthe writer was to make visible in the human scene the operations\\nof universal order -- to unveil the handiwork of Pope\\'s \\'Unerring\\nNature, still divinely bright,/One clear, unchanged and universal\\nlight\\'.\\nThis much wider perspective on character obviously reduces the\\nimportance which will be attached to the nature and actions of\\nany particular individual entity -- they are mainly interesting as\\nmanifestations of the great pattern of Nature. This informs\\nFielding\\'s treatment of every aspect of characterisation -- not\\nonly the extent to which his dramatis personae are\\nindividualised, but the degree of attention paid to their subjective\\nlives, to their moral development, and to their personal\\nrelationships.\\nFielding\\'s primary objectives in the portrayal of character are\\nclear but limited: to assign them to their proper category by\\ngiving as few diagnostic features as are necessary for the task.\\nSuch was his conception of \\'invention\\' or \\'creation\\': \\'a quick and\\nsagacious penetration into the true essence of all the objects of\\nour contemplation\\'. 1 This meant in practice that once the\\nindividual had been appropriately labelled the author\\'s only\\nremaining duty was to see that he continued to speak and act\\nconsistently. As Aristotle put it in the Poetics, \\'character\\' is \\'that\\nwhich reveals the moral purpose\\', and consequently \\'speeches ...\\nwhich do not make this manifest... are not expressive of\\ncharacter\\'. 2 Parson Supple must never cease to be supple.\\n____________________\\nBk. IX, ch. 1.\\nCh. 6, No. 17.\\n-271-\\nSo it is that Fielding does not make any attempt to individualise\\nhis characters. Allworthy is sufficiently categorised by his name,\\nwhile that of Tom Jones, compounded as it is out of two of the\\ncommonest names in the language, tells us that we must regard\\nhim as the representative of manhood in general, in accordance\\nwith his creator\\'s purpose to show \\'not men, but manners; not\\nan individual, but a species\\'. 1\\nThe scope of the word \\'manners\\' has dwindled so drastically in\\nthe last few centuries -- no doubt as a result of the way\\nindividualism has reduced the areas in which identity of thought\\nand action is generally expected -- that the phrase \\'characters of\\n277\\nmanners\\' no longer means very much. It can perhaps be best\\nexplained in terms of the contrast with Richardson\\'s \\'characters\\nof nature\\'. Richardson\\'s literary objective, as B. W. Downs has\\npointed out, 2 is not so much character -- the stable elements in\\nthe individual\\'s mental and moral constitution -- as personality:\\nhe does not analyse Clarissa, but presents a complete and\\ndetailed behavioural report on, her whole being: she is defined\\nby the fullness of our participation in her life. Fielding\\'s purpose,\\non the other hand, is analytic: he is not interested in the exact\\nconfiguration of motives in any particular person\\'s mind at any\\nparticular time but only in those features of the individual which\\nare necessary to assign him to his moral and social species. He\\ntherefore studies each character in the light of his general\\nknowledge of human behaviour, of \\'manners\\', and anything\\npurely individual is of no taxonomic value. Nor is there any need\\nto look inside: if, as Johnson said, Fielding gives us the husk, it is\\nbecause the surface alone is usually quite sufficient to identify\\nthe specimen -- the expert does not need to assay the kernel.\\nThere are many other reasons for Fielding\\'s predominantly\\nexternal approach to character, reasons of a social and\\nphilosophical as well as of a literary order. To begin with, the\\nopposite approach involved a breach of decorum: as Fielding\\'s\\ncousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu pointed out, it was very bad\\nmanners for Richardson\\'s heroines to \\'declare all they think\\',\\nsince \\'fig leaves are as necessary for our minds as our bodies\\'. 3\\nIt was also consistent with the classical tradition as a whole, as\\nwe have seen, to avoid the intimate and confessional\\n____________________\\n1 J oseph Andrews, Bk. III, ch. 1.\\n2 R ichardson, pp. 125-126.\\n3 L etters and Works, II, 291.\\n-272-\\napproach to personality; and in any case the philosophical\\nproblems of self-consciousness had only begun to receive\\nattention some six centuries after Aristotle in the works of\\nPlotinus. 1 Lastly, as was evident in the treatment of Blifil and\\nSophia, Fielding\\'s comic purpose itself required an external\\napproach, and for a compelling reason. If we identify ourselves\\nwith the characters we shall not be in any mood to appreciate\\nthe humour of the larger comedy in which they are risible\\nparticipants: life, we have been told, is a comedy only to the\\nman who thinks, and the comic author must not make us feel\\nevery stroke of the lash as his characters squirm under his\\n278\\ncorrective rod.\\nAt all events, Fielding avowedly and even ostentatiously refused\\nto go too deep into the minds of his characters, on the general\\ngrounds that \\'it is our province to relate facts, and we shall leave\\ncauses to persons of much higher genius\\'. We have noted how\\nlittle was said about the feelings, as opposed to the rational\\ndeterminations, of Blifil and Sophia. This was quite conscious on\\nFielding\\'s part: he had already remarked ironically of Blifil that \\'it\\nwould be an ill office in us to pay a visit to the inmost recesses of\\nhis mind, as some scandalous people search into the most secret\\naffairs of their friends, and often pry into their closets and\\ncupboards, only to discover their poverty and meanness to the\\nworld\\'; similarly when Fielding came to present Sophia\\'s feelings\\nwhen she first learned of Tom\\'s love, he excused himself in the\\nwords: \\'as to the present situation of her mind I shall adhere to\\nthe rule of Horace, by not attempting to describe it, from despair\\nof success\\'. 2\\nFielding\\'s avoidance of the subjective dimension, then, is quite\\nintentional: but that does not, of course, mean that it has no\\ndrawbacks, for it undoubtedly has, and they become very\\napparent whenever important emotional climaxes are reached.\\nColeridge, for all his love of Fielding, pointed out that in the\\nsoliloquies between Sophia and Tom Jones before their final\\nreconciliation, nothing could be \\'more forced and unnatural: the\\nlanguage is without vivacity or spirit, the whole matter is\\nincongruous, and totally devoid of psychological truth\\'. 3 In fact,\\nFielding merely gave us a stock comic scene: elevated\\nsentiments of penitent ardour on the hero\\'s part were countered\\nby wronged womanhood\\'s equally elevated scorn of her faithless\\nsuitor.\\n____________________\\n1 S ee A.

Blanchard, Fielding, p. 317.\\n-273-\\nSoon after, of course, Sophia accepts Tom, and we are surprised\\nby her very sudden and unexplained reversal: the dénouement\\nhas been given a certain comic life, but at the expense of the\\nreality of emotions involved.\\nThis emotional artificiality is very general in Tom Jones. When\\nthe hero, for instance, is expelled from Allworthy\\'s house we are\\n279\\ntold that \\'. . . he presently fell into the most violent agonies,\\ntearing his hair from his head, and using most other actions\\nwhich generally accompany fits of madness, rage and despair\\';\\nand later that he read Sophia\\'s parting letter \\'a hundred times\\nover, and kissed it a hundred times as often\\'. 1 Fielding\\'s use of\\nthese hackneyed hyperboles to vouch for the intensity of the\\nemotions of his characters underlines the price that he pays for\\nhis comic approach: it denies him a convincing and continuous\\naccess to the inner life of his characters, so that whenever he\\nhas to exhibit their emotional life, he can only do it externally by\\nmaking them have exaggerated physical reactions.\\nThe fact that Fielding\\'s characters do not have a convincing inner\\nlife means that their possibilities of psychological development\\nare very limited. Tom Jones\\'s character, for example, exhibits\\nsome development, but it is of a very general kind. Tom\\'s early\\nimprudences, his youthful lack of worldly wisdom, and his\\nhealthy animality, for example, lead to his disgrace, his expulsion\\nfrom the Allworthy household, his subsequent difficulties on the\\nroad and in London, and his apparently irrecoverable loss of\\nSophia\\'s love. At the same time his good qualities, his courage,\\nhonour and benevolence, all of which have been glimpsed at the\\nbeginning, eventually combine to extricate him from the nadir of\\nhis misfortunes, and restore him to the love and respect of those\\nwho surround him. But although different qualities come to the\\nfore at different times they have all been present from the\\nbeginning, and we have not been taken close enough to Tom\\'s\\nmind to be able to do anything but take on trust Fielding\\'s\\nimplication, which is that his hero will be able to control his\\nweaknesses by the wisdom he has learned of experience.\\nIn taking this essentially static view of human nature Fielding\\nwas following the time-hallowed Aristotelian view, which was\\nactually held with much greater rigidity by most of the\\n____________________\\nBk. VI, ch. 12.\\n-274-\\nphilosophers and literary critics of his time. 1 It is, of course, an\\na-historical view of character, as Fielding showed in Joseph\\nAndrews, when he asserted that his characters were \\'taken from\\nthe life\\', but added that the particular lawyer in question was \\'not\\nonly alive, but hath been so this four thousand years\\'. 2 It follows\\nlogically that if human nature is essentially stable, there is no\\nneed to detail the processes whereby any one example of it has\\n281\\nreached its full development; such processes are but temporary\\nand superficial modifications of a moral constitution which is\\nunalterably fixed from birth. Such, for example, is the premise of\\nthe way that although Tom and Blifil share the same mother and\\nare brought up in the same household by the same tutors, their\\nrespective courses are unalterably set in different directions from\\nthe very beginning.\\nOnce again the contrast with Richardson is complete. Much of\\nour sense of Clarissa\\'s psychological development arises from the\\nway that her experience brings a continual deepening of her\\nunderstanding of her own past: as a result character and plot are\\nindivisible. Tom Jones, on the other hand, is not in touch with his\\nown past at all: we feel a certain unreality in his actions because\\nthey always seem to be spontaneous reactions to stimuli that the\\nplot has been manipulated to provide; we have no sense that\\nthey are manifestations of a developing moral life. We cannot but\\nfeel surprise, for instance, when, immediately after accepting 50\\npounds from Lady Bellaston, Tom gives his famous lecture to\\nNightingale on sexual ethics. 3 It is not that the two actions are\\ninherently contradictory -- Tom\\'s ethics have throughout been\\nbased on the much greater heinousness of harming others than\\nof failing to live up to one\\'s moral code oneself; but if we had\\nbeen given some indication that Tom was aware of the apparent\\ncontradictions between his speech and his own past practice he\\nmight have sounded less priggish and more convincing. Actually,\\nof course, separate parts of Tom\\'s nature can hold very little\\nconverse with each other, because there is only one agency for\\nsuch converse -- the individual consciousness through which the\\nwhole repertoire of past actions operates -- and Fielding does not\\ntake us into this consciousness because he believes that\\nindividual character is a specific\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Leslie Stephen, English Thought in the Eighteenth Century(\\nLondon, 1902), II, 73-74; R.

XIV, ch. 7.\\n-275-\\ncombination of stable and separate predispositions to action,\\nrather than the product of its own past.\\nFor the same reasons personal relationships are also relatively\\nunimportant in Tom Jones. If there is a controlling force\\n281\\nindependent of the individual actors and their positions with\\nrespect to each other, and if their own characters are innate and\\nunchanging, there is no reason why Fielding should give close\\nattention to their mutual feelings, since they cannot play a\\ndecisive role. Here, again, the scene between Sophia and Blifil\\nwas typical in that it reflected the extent to which the structure\\nof Tom Jones as a whole depends on the lack of any effective\\ncommunication between the characters: just as Blifil must\\nmisunderstand Sophia, so Allworthy must fail to see Blifil in his\\ntrue light, and Tom must be unable either to understand Blifil\\'s\\ntrue nature or to explain himself properly either to Allworthy or\\nSophia until the closing scenes. For, since Fielding\\'s view of\\nhuman life and his general literary purpose did not permit him to\\nsubordinate his plot to the deepening exploration of personal\\nrelationships, he needed a structure based on an elaborate\\ncounterpoint of deception and surprise, and this would be\\nimpossible if the characters could share each other\\'s minds and\\ntake their fates into their own hands.\\nThere is, then, an absolute connection in Tom Jones between the\\ntreatment of plot and of character. Plot has priority, and it is\\ntherefore plot which must contain the elements of complication\\nand development. Fielding achieves this by superimposing on a\\ncentral action that is, in essentials as simple as that in Clarissa, a\\nvery complex series of relatively autonomous subplots and\\nepisodes which are in the nature of dramatic variations on the\\nmain theme. These relatively independent narrative units are\\ncombined in a concatenation whose elaboration and symmetry is\\nsuggested in the most obvious outward aspect of the book\\'s\\nformal order: unlike the novels of Defoe and Richardson, Tom\\nJones is carefully divided into compositional units of different\\nsizes -- some two hundred chapters which are themselves\\ngrouped into eighteen books disposed into three groups of six,\\ndealing respectively with the early lives, the journeys to London,\\nand the activities on arrival, of the main characters.\\nThis extreme diversification of the narrative texture reinforces, of\\ncourse, Fielding\\'s tendency not to dwell for long on any one\\n-276-\\nscene or character. In the passages quoted, for example, there\\nwas none of the intensive treatment which Richardson gave to\\nClarissa\\'s interview with Solmes; most of Fielding\\'s time was\\nspent on making clear the initial misunderstanding, and the scale\\nof the scene allowed no more in the way of characterisation than\\na designing hypocrite, a trapped maiden and a heavy father. But\\n282\\neven if there had been any full absorption in the feelings of\\nSophia, for example, it would soon have been terminated by the\\nmanagement of the ensuing scenes: for, just as we left Sophia\\nimmediately after Squire Western had stormed out of the room,\\nand were thus spared any prolonged awareness of her sufferings,\\nso in the next chapter our attention was soon switched away\\nfrom her parting interview with Tom Jones by Fielding\\'s\\nannouncement that \\'. . . the scene, which I believe some of my\\nreaders will think had lasted long enough, was interrupted by\\none of so different a nature, that we shall reserve the relation of\\nit for a different chapter\\'. 1\\nThis is typical of the narrative mode of Tom Jones: the author\\'s\\ncommentary makes no secret of the fact that his aim is not to\\nimmerse us wholly in his fictional world, but rather to show the\\ningenuity of his own inventive resources by contriving an\\namusing counterpoint of scenes and characters; quick changes\\nare the essence of Fielding\\'s comic manner, and a new chapter\\nwill always bring a new situation for the characters, or present\\ndifferent characters in a similar scene for ironical contrast. In\\naddition, by a great variety of devices, of which the chapter\\nheadings are usually significant pointers, our attention is\\ncontinually drawn to the fact that the ultimate cohesive force of\\nthe book resides not in the characters and their relationships, but\\nin an intellectual and literary structure which has a considerable\\ndegree of autonomy.\\nThe effects of this procedure and its relationship to Fielding\\'s\\ntreatment of character can be summarised in relation to a brief\\nscene which occurs after Tom has heard that Allworthy is to\\nrecover from his illness. He takes a walk \\'in a most delicious\\ngrove\\', and contemplates the cruelty of fortune which separates\\nhim from his beloved Sophia:\\nWas I but possessed of thee, one only suit of rags thy whole\\nestate, is there a man on earth whom I would envy! How\\ncontemptible\\n____________________\\nBk. VI, ch. 8.\\n-277-\\nwould the brightest Circassian beauty, dressed in all the jewels of\\nthe Indies, appear to my eyes! But why do I mention another\\nwoman? Could I think my eyes capable of looking at any other with\\ntenderness, these hands should tear them from my head. No, my\\n283\\nSophia, if cruel fortune separates us for ever, my soul shall dote on\\nthee alone. The chastest constancy will I ever preserve to thy\\nimage...\\nAt these words he started up and beheld -- not his Sophia -- no, nor\\na Circassian maid richly and elegantly attired for the grand Signior\\'s\\nseraglio...\\nbut Molly Scagrim, with whom, \\'after a parley\\' which Fielding omits,\\nTom retires to \\'the thickest part of the grove\\'. 1\\nThe least convincing aspect of the episode is the diction: the speech\\nhabits manifested here obviously bear little relation to those we\\nexpect of Tom Jones. But, of course, they are a stylistic necessity\\nfor Fielding\\'s immediate purpose -- the comic deflation of the heroic\\nand romantic pretences of the human word by the unheroic and\\nunromantic eloquence of the human deed. Tom Jones is no more\\nthan a vehicle for the expression of Fielding\\'s scepticism about\\nlovers\\' vows; and he must be made to speak in terms that parody\\nthe high-flown rhetoric of the pastoral romance to give point to the\\nsucceeding wayside encounter which belongs to the very different\\nworld of the pastourelle. Nor can Fielding pause to detail the\\npsychological processes whereby Tom is metamorphosed from\\nSophia\\'s romantic lover to Moll\\'s prompt gallant: to illustrate the\\ncommonplace that \\'actions speak louder than words\\', the actions\\nmust be very silent and they must follow very hard upon very loud\\nwords.\\nThe relation of this episode to the larger structure of the novel is\\ntypical. One of Fielding\\'s general organising themes is the proper\\nplace of sex in human life; this encounter neatly illustrates the\\nconflicting tendencies of headstrong youth, and shows that Tom has\\nnot yet reached the continence of moral adulthood. The scene,\\ntherefore, plays its part in the general moral and intellectual\\nscheme; and it is also significantly connected with the workings of\\nthe plot, since Tom\\'s lapse eventually becomes a factor in his\\ndismissal by Allworthy, and therefore leads to the ordeals which\\neventually make him a worthier mate for Sophia.\\nAt the same time Fielding\\'s treatment of the scene is also\\n____________________\\nBk. V, ch. 10.\\n-278-\\ntypical in avoiding any detailed presentation of Tom\\'s feelings\\n284\\neither at the time or later -- to take his hero\\'s faithlessness too\\nseriously would jeopardise Fielding\\'s primarily comic intention in\\nthe episode, and he therefore manipulates it in such a way as to\\ndiscourage us from giving it a significance which it might have in\\nordinary life. Comedy, and especially comedy on an elaborate\\nscale, often involves this kind of limited liability to psychological\\ninterpretation: it applies to Blifil\\'s malice and to Sophia\\'s\\nsufferings in the scenes quoted earlier, and Allworthy\\'s sudden\\nillness and recovery, which have led to Tom\\'s lapse, must be\\nplaced in the same perspective. We must not dwell on the\\napparent fact that Allworthy is incapable of distinguishing\\nbetween a cold and a mortal illness, since we are not intended to\\ndraw the implications for his character that he is either an\\noutrageous hypochondriac or lamentably unskilled in choosing\\nphysicians: Allworthy\\'s illness is only a diplomatic chill, and we\\nmust not infer anything from it except a shift in Fielding\\'s\\nnarrative policy.\\nTom Jones, then, would seem to exemplify a principle of\\nconsiderable significance for the novel form in general: namely,\\nthat the importance of the plot is in inverse proportion to that of\\ncharacter. This principle has an interesting corollary: the\\norganisation of the narrative into an extended and complex\\nformal structure will tend to turn the protagonists into its passive\\nagents, but it will offer compensatingly greater opportunities for\\nthe introduction of a variety of minor characters, whose\\ntreatment will not be hampered in the same way by the roles\\nwhich they are allotted by the complications of the narrative\\ndesign.\\nThe principle and its corollary would seem to lie behind\\nColeridge\\'s contrast of the \\'forced and unnatural quality\\' of the\\nscenes between the protagonists in Tom Jones and Fielding\\'s\\ntreatment of the \\'characters of postilions, landlords, landladies,\\nwaiters\\' where \\'nothing can be more true, more happy or more\\nhumorous\\'. 1 These minor characters figure only in scenes which\\nrequire exactly the amount of psychological individuality which\\nthey are possessed of; relieved of any responsibility for carrying\\nout the major narrative design Mrs. Honour can get herself\\ndismissed from the Western household by methods which are at\\n____________________\\n1 C it.

From Sterne and Jane Austen to Proust and\\nJoyce the Aristotelian priority of plot over character has been\\nwholly reversed, and a new type of formal structure has been\\nevolved in which the plot attempts only to embody the ordinary\\nprocesses of life and in so doing becomes wholly dependent on\\nthe characters and the development of their relationships. It is\\nDefoe and above all Richardson who provide this tradition with\\nits archetypes, just as it is Fielding who provides that for the\\nopposite tradition.\\nIII\\nJohnson\\'s most famous criticism of Fielding\\'s novels is concerned\\nwith their basic technique, but from his own point of view it was\\nprobably their moral shortcomings which were the decisive\\nfactor. It is certainly this with which he was concerned in his only\\npublished reference to Fielding, although even here it is only by\\nimplication. In the Rambler ( 1750) Johnson attacked the effects\\nof \\'familiar\\' histories\\' whose wicked heroes were made so\\nattractive that \\'we lose abhorrence of their faults\\', apparently\\nwith Roderick Random ( 1748) and Tom Jones ( 1749) chiefly in\\nmind. 2 He certainly later told Hannah More that he \\'scarcely\\nknew a more corrupt work\\' than Tom Jones, 3 and, on\\n____________________\\nBk. VII, Ch. 7.\\n2 No. 4.\\n3 J ohnsonian Miscellanies, II, 190.\\n286\\n-280-\\nthe other hand, praised Clarissa on the significant grounds that\\n\\'It was in the power of Richardson alone to teach us at once\\nesteem and detestation; to make virtuous resentment overpower\\nall the benevolence which wit, elegance, and courage naturally\\nexcite, and to lose at last the hero in the villain\\'. 1\\nWe find it difficult today to share much of Johnson\\'s abhorrence\\nof the morality of Tom Jones and are, indeed, more likely to be\\nunjust to Richardson, and to assume without question that his\\nconcern, and that of his heroines, for feminine chastity, can only\\nbe explained by prurience on his part or hypocrisy on theirs. But\\nthis may not be so, and, conversely, we must in fairness\\nrecognise that there are many moral offences in Tom Jones\\nwhich receive a much more tolerant treatment than any Puritan\\nmoralist would have accorded them. Defoe and Richardson, for\\nexample, are unsparing in their denunciation of drunkenness;\\nbut when Tom Jones gets drunk in his joy at Allworthy\\'s\\nrecovery, Fielding shows no reprobation: it is admittedly an\\nimprudence which later contributes to the hero\\'s expulsion, but\\nFielding\\'s only direct comment is a humorous editorial\\ndevelopment of the in vino veritas commonplace. 2\\nIt is the sexual issue, however, which is crucial, both in the\\nmoral scheme of Tom Jones, and in the objections of its critics.\\nFielding certainly does not endorse his hero\\'s incontinence, and\\nTom himself admits that he has been \\'faulty\\' in this respect; but\\nthe general tendency throughout the novel is surely to qualify\\nthe condemnation and make unchastity appear a venial sin --\\neven the good Mrs. Miller, for example, seems to think she has\\nput a fairly good face on matters by pleading to Sophia that Tom\\nhas \\'never been guilty of a single instance of infidelity to her\\nsince... seeing her in town\\'. 3\\nFielding\\'s plot obviously does not punish the sexual\\ntransgressions either of Tom Jones or of the many other\\ncharacters who are guilty in this respect so severely as\\nRichardson, for example, would have wished. Even in Amelia,\\nwhere Booth\\'s adultery is both more serious in itself than\\nanything that can be charged against Tom Jones, and is treated\\nmuch more severely by Fielding, the plot eventually rescues\\nBooth from the consequences of his acts. There is therefore\\nconsiderable justification for Ford Madox Ford\\'s denunciation of\\n\\'fellows like Fielding,\\n287\\n____________________\\n1 \" Rowe\", Lives of the Poets, ed. Hill, II, 67.\\nBk. V, ch. 9.\\nBk. XVIII, ch. 10.\\n-281-\\nand to some extent Thackeray, who pretend that if you are a gay\\ndrunkard, lecher, squanderer of your goods and fumbler in\\nplacket holes you will eventually find a benevolent uncle,\\nconcealed father or benefactor who will shower on you bags of\\nten thousands of guineas, estates, and the hands of adorable\\nmistresses-these fellows are dangers to the body politic and\\nhorribly bad constructors of plots\\'. 1\\nFord, of course, chooses to disregard both Fielding\\'s positive\\nmoral intentions and the tendency of comic plots in general to\\nachieve a happy ending at the cost of certain lenity in the\\nadministration of justice. For -- although Fielding was long\\nregarded as something of a debauchee himself and did not\\nindeed have full justice done to his literary greatness until\\nscholarship had cleared him of the charges made by\\ncontemporary gossip and repeated by his first biographer,\\nMurphy -Fielding was in fact as much of a moralist as\\nRichardson, although of a different kind. He believed that virtue,\\nfar from being the result of the suppression of instinct at the\\nbehest of public opinion, was itself a natural tendency to\\ngoodness or benevolence. In Tom Jones he tried to show a hero\\npossessed of a virtuous heart, but also of the lustiness and lack\\nof deliberation to which natural goodness was particularly prone,\\nand which easily led to error and even to vice. To realise his\\nmoral aim, therefore, Fielding had to show how the good heart\\nwas threatened by many dangers in its hazardous course to\\nmaturity and knowledge of the world; yet, at the same time and\\nwithout exculpating his hero, he had also to show that although\\nTom\\'s moral transgressions were a likely and perhaps even a\\nnecessary stage in the process of moral growth, they did not\\nbetoken a vicious disposition; even Tom Jones\\'s carefree\\nanimality has a generous quality that is lacking in Clarissa\\'s selfcentred\\nand frigid virtue. The happy conclusion of the story,\\ntherefore, is very far from representing the kind of moral and\\nliterary confusion which Ford alleges, and is actually the\\nculmination of Fielding\\'s moral and literary logic.\\nThe contrast between Fielding and Richardson as moralists is\\nheightened by the effects of their very different narrative points\\nof view. Richardson focusses attention on the individual, and\\n288\\nwhatever virtue or vice he is dealing with will loom very\\n____________________\\n1 T he English Novel from the Earliest Days to the Death of\\nConrad ( London, 1930),p. 93.\\n-282-\\nlarge, and have all its implications reflected in the action:\\nFielding, on the other hand, deals with too many characters and\\ntoo complicated a plot to give the single individual virtue or vice\\nquite this importance.\\nBesides this tendency of the plot, it is also part of Fielding\\'s\\nintention as a moralist to put every phenomenon into its larger\\nperspective. Sexual virtue and sexual vice, for example, are\\nplaced in a broad moral perspective, and the results do not\\nalways produce the kind of emphasis that the sexual reformer\\nwould wish. Fielding knows, for example, and wishes to show,\\nthat some marriage designs may be more vicious than the most\\nabandoned profligacy: witness Blifil whose \\'designs were strictly\\nhonourable as the phrase is, that is to rob a lady of her fortune\\nby marriage\\'. He knows, too, that moral indignation against\\npromiscuity is not necessarily the result of a real love of virtue:\\nwitness the passage in which we are told that \\'to exclude all\\nvulgar concubinage, and to drive all whores in rags from within\\nthe walls is within the power of everyone. This my landlady very\\nstrictly adhered to, and this her virtuous guests, who did not\\ntravel in rags, would very reasonably have expected from her.\\' 1\\nHere Fielding\\'s Swiftian suavity reminds us of the cruelty and\\ninjustice with which complacent virtue is too often associated;\\nbut a narrow-minded moralist might see behind the irony a\\nshocking failure to condemn \\'whores in rags\\', and even, perhaps,\\nan implicit sympathy for them.\\nFielding, then, attempts to broaden our moral sense rather than\\nto intensify its punitive operations against licentiousness. But, at\\nthe same time, his function as the voice of traditional social\\nmorality means that his attitude to sexual ethics is inevitably\\nnormative; it certainly does not, as Boswell said, \\'encourage a\\nstrained and rarely possible virtue\\', 2 but rather reflects, as Leslie\\nStephen put it, \\'the code by which men of sense generally\\ngovern their conduct, as distinguished from that by which they\\naffect to be governed in language\\'. 3 Aristotle\\'s Golden Mean is\\noften, perhaps, capable of a certain subversion of rigid ethical\\nprinciples: and it is perhaps as a good Aristotelian that Fielding\\ncomes very close to suggesting that too much chastity in Blifil is\\n289\\nas bad as Tom\\'s too little.\\n____________________\\nBk. XI, ch. 4; Bk. IX, ch. 3.\\n2 L ife of Johnson, ed. Hill-Powell, II, 49.\\n3 E nglish Thought in the Eighteenth Century, II, 377.\\n-283-\\nThere is a further reason why Johnson, who was, after all, an\\nethical rigorist in his own way, should have found Tom Jones a\\ncorrupt work. Comedy -- if only to maintain an atmosphere of\\ngood-humour between audience and participants -- often\\ninvolves a certain complicity in acts and sentiments which we\\nmight not treat so tolerantly in ordinary life. Perhaps the most\\ninsistent note in Tom Jones is Fielding\\'s worldly-wise\\ngoodhumour, and it often persuades us to regard sexual\\nirregularities as ludicrous rather than wicked.\\nMrs. Fitzpatrick, or instance, is dismissed with the words: \\'she\\nlives in reputation at the polite end of town, and is so good an\\neconomist that she spends three times the income of her fortune\\nwithout running into debt\\'. 1 Mrs. Fitzpatrick must remain true to\\ncharacter, and yet be included in the happy ending; nor can\\nFielding upset the conviviality of his final meeting with his\\nreaders to express his abhorrence at the lamentable source of\\nincome which we must surmise for his character.\\nOn other occasions, of course, Fielding\\'s humour on that\\nperennial comic resource, sex, is much more overt: in Jonathan\\nWilde, for example, when the captain of the ship asks the hero \\'if\\nhe had no more Christianity in him than to ravish a woman in a\\nstorm?\\' 2 or in Tom Jones when Mrs. Honour gives her celebrated\\nretort to Sophia\\'s \\'Would you not, Honour, fire a pistol at any one\\nwho should attack your virtue?\\' -- \\'To be sure, ma\\'am,... one\\'s\\nvirtue is a dear thing, especially to us poor servants; for it is our\\nlivelihood, as a body may say: yet I mortally hate firearms. 3\\nThere is, of course, the same broadening tendency in Fielding\\'s\\nhumour here as in his treatment of moral issues in general: we\\nmust not forget that even the most virtuous indignation is\\ncapable of elementary logical fallacies, or that humankind\\'s\\nallegiance to virtue is capable of cautious afterthoughts. But the\\ntacit assumption of much of Fielding\\'s humour is surely one\\nwhich suggests that \\'broad-mindedness\\' in its modern sense,\\nwhich typically tends to have a sexual reference, is part of the\\nexpansion of sympathy to which his novels as a whole invite us:\\na relish for wholesome bawdy, in fact, is a necessary part of the\\n291\\nmoral education of a sex-bedevilled humanity: such, at least,\\nwas the classical role of comedy, and Fielding was perhaps the\\nlast great writer who continued that tradition.\\n____________________\\nBk. XVIII, ch. 13.\\nBk. II, ch. 10.\\nBk. VII, ch. 7.\\n-284-\\nIV\\nAs far as most modern readers are concerned it is not Fielding\\'s\\nmoral but his literary point of view which is open to objection.\\nFor his conception of his role is that of a guide who, not content\\nwith taking us \\'behind the scenes of this great theatre of nature\\',\\n1 feels that he must explain everything which is to be found\\nthere; and such authorial intrusion, of course, tends to diminish\\nthe authenticity of his narrative.\\nFielding\\'s personal intrusion into Tom Jones begins with his\\ndedication to the Honourable George Lyttleton, a dedication, it\\nmust be admitted, which goes far to justify Johnson\\'s definition\\nof this form of writing -- \\'a servile address to a patron\\'. There are\\nnumerous further references in the body of his work to others\\namong Fielding\\'s patrons, notably Ralph Allen and Lord\\nChancellor Hardwicke, not to mention other acquaintances whom\\nFielding wished to compliment, including one of his surgeons, Mr.\\nJohn Ranby, and various innkeepers.\\nThe effect of these references is certainly to break the spell of\\nthe imaginary world represented in the novel: but the main\\ninterference with the autonomy of this world comes from\\nFielding\\'s introductory chapters, containing literary and moral\\nessays, and even more from his frequent discussions and asides\\nto the reader within the narrative itself. There is no doubt that\\nFielding\\'s practice here leads him in completely the opposite\\ndirection from Richardson, and converts the novel into a social\\nand indeed into a sociable literary form. Fielding brings us into a\\ncharmed circle composed, not only of the fictional characters, but\\nalso of Fielding\\'s friends and of his favourites among the poets\\nand moralists of the past. He is, indeed, almost as attentive to\\nhis audience as to his characters, and his narrative, far from\\nbeing an intimate drama which we peep at through a keyhole, is\\na series of reminiscences told by a genial raconteur in some\\n291\\nwayside inn -- the favoured and public locus of his tale.\\nThis approach to the novel is quite consistent with Fielding\\'s\\nmajor intention -- it promotes a distancing effect which prevents\\nus from being so fully immersed in the lives of the characters\\nthat we lose our alertness to the larger implications of their\\nactions -- implications which Fielding brings out in his capacity of\\nomniscient chorus. On the other hand, Fielding\\'s interventions\\n____________________\\nBk.

Ford Madox Ford, for\\ninstance, complained that the \\'trouble with the English nuvvelist\\nfrom Fielding to Meredith, is that not one of them cares whether\\nyou believe in their characters or not\\'; 3 and Henry James was\\nshocked by the way Trollope, and other \\'accomplished novelists\\',\\nconcede \\'in a digression, a parenthesis or an aside\\' that their\\nfiction is \\'only make-believe\\'. James went on to lay down the\\ncentral principle of the novelist\\'s attitude to his creation, which is\\nvery similar to that described above as inherent in formal\\nrealism: Trollope, and any novelist who shares his attitude,\\nJames says,\\nadmits that the events he narrates have not really happened,\\nand that he can give the narrative any turn the reader may like\\nbest. Such a betrayal of a sacred office seems to me, I confess, a\\nterrible crime; it is what I mean by the attitude of apology, and it\\nshocks me every whit as much in Trollope as it would have\\nshocked me in Gibbon or Macaulay. It implies that the novelist is\\n292\\nless occupied in looking for the truth (the truth of course I mean,\\nthat he assumes, the premises that we must grant him,\\nwhatever they may be) than the historian, and in so doing it\\ndeprives him at a stroke of all his standing room. 4\\nThere is not, of course, any doubt as to Fielding\\'s intention of\\n\\'looking for the truth\\' -- he tells us indeed in Tom Jones that \\'we\\ndetermined to guide our pen throughout by the directions of\\n____________________\\n1 P oetics, chs. 24, 3.\\n2 M cKillop, Richardson, p. 175.\\n3 E nglish Novel, p. 89.\\n4 \" The Art of Fiction\" ( 1884); cited from The Art of Fiction, ed.\\nBishop, p. 5.\\n-286-\\ntruth\\'. But he perhaps underestimated the connection between\\ntruth and the maintenance of the reader\\'s \\'historical faith\\'. This,\\nat least, is the suggestion of a passage towards the end Tom\\nJones when he proclaims that he will let his hero be hanged\\nrather than extricate him from his troubles by unnatural means\\n\\'for we had rather relate that he was hanged at Tyburn (which\\nmay very probably be the case) than forfeit our integrity, or\\nshock the faith of our reader\\'. 1\\nThis ironical attitude towards the reality of his creation was\\nprobably responsible in part for the main critical doubt which\\nTom Jones suggests. It is, in the main, a very true book, but it is\\nby no means so clear that its truth has, to quote R. S. Crane,\\nbeen \\'rendered\\' in terms of the novel. 2 We do not get the\\nimpressive sense of Fielding\\'s own moral qualities from his\\ncharacters or their actions that we do from the heroic struggles\\nfor human betterment which he conducted as a magistrate under\\nthe most adverse personal circumstances, or even from the\\nJournal of a Voyage to Lisbon; and if we analyse our impression\\nfrom the novels alone it surely is evident that our residual\\nimpression of dignity and generosity comes mainly from the\\npassages where Fielding is speaking in his own person. And this,\\nsurely, is the result of a technique which was deficient at least in\\nthe sense that it was unable to convey this larger moral\\nsignificance through character and action alone, and could only\\nsupply it by means of a somewhat intrusive patterning of the plot\\nand by direct editorial commentary. As Henry James put it: Tom\\nJones \\'has so much \"life\" that it amounts, for the effect of\\ncomedy and application of satire, almost to his having a mind\\';\\n293\\nalmost, but not quite, and so it was necessary that \\'his author --\\nhe handsomely possessed of a mind -- [should have] such an\\namplitude of reflection for him and round him that we see him\\nthrough the mellow air of Fielding\\'s fine old moralism...\\'. 3\\nAll this, of course, is not to say Fielding does not succeed: Tom\\nJones is surely entitled to the praise of an anonymous early\\nadmirer who called it \\'on the whole... the most lively book ever\\npublished. 4 But it is a very personal and unrepeatable kind\\n____________________\\nBk.

The tedious\\nasseveration of literal authenticity in Defoe and to some extent in\\nRichardson, tended to obscure the fact that, if the novel was to\\nachieve equality of status with other genres it had to be brought\\ninto contact with the whole tradition of civilised values, and\\nsupplement its realism of presentation with a realism of\\nassessment. To the excellent Mrs. Barbauld\\'s query as to the\\ngrounds on which he considered Richardson to be a lesser writer\\nthan Shakespeare, Coleridge answered that \\' Richardson is only\\ninteresting\\'. 1 This is no doubt unfair as a total judgement on the\\nauthor of Clarissa, but it indicates the likely limits of a realism of\\npresentation: we shall be wholly immersed in the reality of the\\ncharacters and their actions, but whether we shall be any wiser\\nas a result is open to question.\\nFielding brought to the genre something that is ultimately even\\nmore important than narrative technique -- a responsible wisdom\\nabout human affairs which plays upon the deeds and the\\ncharacters of his novels. His wisdom is not, perhaps, of the\\nhighest order; it is, like that of his beloved Lucian, a little inclined\\n294\\nto be easy-going and on occasion opportunist. Nevertheless, at\\nthe end of Tom Jones we feel we have been exposed, not merely\\nto an interesting narrative about imaginary persons, but to a\\nstimulating wealth of suggestion and challenge on almost every\\ntopic of human interest. Not only so: the stimulation has come\\nfrom a mind with a true grasp of human reality, never deceived\\nor deceiving about himself, his characters or the human lot in\\ngeneral. In his effort to infuse the new genre with something of\\nthe Shakespearean virtues Fielding departed too far from formal\\nrealism to initiate a viable tradition, but his work serves as a\\nperpetual reminder that if the new genre was to challenge older\\nliterary forms it had to find a way of conveying not only a\\nconvincing impression but a wise assessment of life, an\\nassessment that could only come from taking a much wider view\\nthan Defoe or Richardson of the affairs of mankind.\\n____________________\\n1 C it.

The annual production of works of\\nfiction, which had averaged only about seven in the years between\\n1700 and 1740, rose to an average of about twenty in the three\\ndecades following 1740, and this output was doubled in the period\\nfrom 1770 to 1800. 1 The quantitative increase, however, was not in\\nany way matched by an increase in quality. With only a few\\nexceptions the fiction of the last half of the eighteenth century,\\nthough occasionally of some interest as evidence of the life of the\\ntime or of various fugitive literary tendencies such as\\n295\\nsentimentalism or Gothic terror, had little intrinsic merit; and much\\nof it reveals only too plainly the pressures towards literary\\ndegradation which were exerted by the booksellers and circulating\\nlibrary operators in their efforts to meet the reading public\\'s\\nuncritical demand for easy vicarious indulgence in sentiment and\\nromance.\\nThere were, however, several novelists who rose above the level of\\nmediocrity and worse, novelists such as Smollett, Sterne and Fanny\\nBurney. Smollett has many merits as a social reporter and as a\\nhumorist, but the manifest flaws in the central situations and the\\ngeneral structure of all his novels except Humphrey Clinker ( 1771)\\nprevent him from playing a very important role in the main tradition\\nof the novel. Sterne is a very different matter, and although his\\nremarkable literary originality gives his work a wholly personal, not\\nto say eccentric, quality, his only novel, Tristram Shandy ( 1760-\\n1767), offers very provocative solutions of the major formal\\nproblems which had been raised by his predecessors; for, on the\\none hand, Sterne found a way of reconciling Richardson\\'s realism of\\npresentation with Fielding\\'s\\n____________________\\n1 T hese figures, presented with the greatest possible reserve, were\\ncompiled from A.

As a\\nresult, many of the scenes in Tristram Shandy achieve a living\\nauthenticity that combines Defoe\\'s brilliant economy of\\nsuggestion with Richardson\\'s more minutely discriminated\\npresentation of the momentary thoughts, feelings and gestures\\nof his characters. So assured, indeed, is this mastery of realistic\\n296\\npresentation that, had it been applied to the usual purposes of\\nthe novel, Sterne would probably have been the supreme figure\\namong eighteenth-century novelists. But, of course, Tristram\\nShandy is not so much a novel as a parody of a novel, and, with\\na precocious technical maturity, Sterne turns his irony against\\nmany of the narrative methods which the new genre had so\\nlately developed.\\nThis ironical tendency is particularly focussed on the hero\\nhimself. Pursuing the naming-convention of formal realism,\\nSterne tells us exactly how his character was named, and how\\nthis alone is a symbol of its bearer\\'s unhappy destiny; and yet, of\\ncourse, poor Tristram remains an elusive figure, perhaps because\\nphilosophy has taught him that personal identity is not so simple\\na question as is commonly assumed: when the commissary asks\\nhim\\' -- And who are you?\\', he can only reply, \\'Don\\'t puzzle me\\', 1\\nthereby resuming the tenor of Hume\\'s sceptical thoughts on the\\nsubject in the Treatise of Human Nature. 2 But the main reason\\nwhy Sterne\\'s hero continues to escape us is that his author plays\\nfast and loose with what is probably the most basic of the\\nproblems of formal realism, the treatment of the time dimension\\nin narrative.\\nThe primary temporal sequence of Tristram Shandy is based --\\nagain in accord with the recent tendencies in the philosophy of\\nthe time -- on the flow of associations in the consciousness of\\nthe narrator. Since everything that occurs in the mind occurs in\\nthe present, this enables Sterne to portray some of his scenes\\nwith all the vividness which Richardson\\'s \\'lively present-tense\\n____________________\\nBk. I, ch. 9; Bk. VII, ch. 33.\\nSee Bk. I, pt. 4, sect. vi.\\n-291-\\nmanner\\' had made possible; at the same time, since Tristram\\nShandy is recounting the story of his own \\'life and opinions\\',\\nSterne can also command the longer temporal perspectives of\\nDefoe\\'s autobiographical memoir; while, in addition, he adopts\\nFielding\\'s innovation in the treatment of time by correlating his\\nfictional actions with an external time-scheme -- the chronology\\nof the history of the Shandy household is consistent with the\\ndates of such historical events as Uncle Toby\\'s battles in\\nFlanders. 1\\nSterne, however, is not satisfied with this skilful handling of the\\n297\\ntime problem, and proceeds to take to its logical extreme the\\nultimate realist premise of a one-to-one correspondence between\\nliterature and reality. He proposes to make an absolute temporal\\nequivalent between his novel and his reader\\'s experience of it by\\nproviding an hour\\'s reading matter for every hour in his hero\\'s\\nwaking life. But this, of course, is a forlorn enterprise, since it\\nwill always take Tristram much more than an hour to write down\\nan account of an hour of his own experience, and so the more he\\nwrites and the more we read, the more our common objective\\nrecedes.\\nThus Sterne, largely by taking the temporal requirements of\\nformal realism more literally than had ever been attempted\\nbefore -- or since -- achieves a reductio ad absurdum of the\\nnovel form itself. At the same time, however, this sly subversion\\nof the proper purposes of the novel has recently bestowed upon\\nTristram Shandy a certain posthumous topicality. Sterne\\'s very\\nflexible handling of the time-scheme of his novel prefigures the\\nbreak with the tyranny of chronological order in the conduct of\\nnarrative which was made by Proust, Joyce and Virginia Woolf,\\nand Sterne therefore found renewed critical favour in the\\n\\'twenties as a precursor of the moderns. Nor is this all: the\\ngreatest contemporary exponent of philosophical realism,\\nBertrand Russell, modelled his own statement of the problematic\\nnature of time on Tristram Shandy and named his paradox after\\nSterne\\'s infinitely regressive hero. 2\\nSterne\\'s handling of the temporal dimension in Tristram Shandy\\nis of crucial importance in yet another context, since it provides\\nthe technical basis for his combination of realism of\\n____________________\\n1 S ee Theodore Baird, \"The Time Scheme of Tristram Shandy\\nand a Source\", PMLA, LI ( 1936), 803-820.\\n2 P rinciples of Mathematics ( London, 1937), pp. 358-360.\\n-292-\\npresentation with realism of assessment. Sterne, like Fielding,\\nwas a scholar and a wit, and he was equally anxious to have full\\nfreedom to comment on the action of his novel or indeed on\\nanything else. But whereas Fielding had gained this freedom only\\nby impairing the verisimilitude of his narrative, Sterne was able\\nto achieve exactly the same ends without any such sacrifice by\\nthe simple but ingenious expedient of locating his reflections in\\nthe mind of his hero -- the most recondite allusion could thus be\\nlaid at the door of the notorious inconsequences of the processes\\n298\\nof the association of ideas.\\nFielding\\'s realism of assessment did not operate only through\\ndirect commentary; his evaluations were also made explicit by\\norganising the narrative sequence into a significant counterpoint\\nof scenes which usually reflected ironically upon each other,\\nalthough often at the cost of giving the reader a sense of\\nsomewhat obtrusive manipulation. Sterne, however, can\\nmanipulate until we are giddy without any breach of narrative\\nauthenticity, since every transition is part of the hero\\'s mental\\nlife which, of course, is very little concerned with chronological\\norder. As a result Sterne is able to arrange the elements of his\\nnovel into whatever sequence he pleases, without the arbitrary\\nchanges of setting and characters which such a counterpoint\\nwould involve in Fielding.\\nThis freedom, however, Sterne treats in exactly the same way as\\nhe treats his freedom in the use of the time dimension, and as a\\nresult his novel\\'s principle of organisation eventually ceases to be\\nnarrative in the ordinary sense. The ultimate implications of\\nSterne\\'s mastery of the technique for achieving realism of\\nassessment without compromising authenticity are therefore\\nlargely negative; but even here, of course, objection is\\nimpossible within Sterne\\'s fictional terms, since, although we\\nmay be entitled to expect some degree of order in an author, it\\nwould hardly be reasonable to expect it from the workings of the\\nmind of Tristram Shandy.\\nSterne\\'s narrative methods in general, then, bear a more central\\nrelationship to the main traditions of the novel than at first\\nappears; we may feel that he has undermined the methods of\\nRichardson and Fielding rather than reconciled them, but there\\ncan at least be no doubt that he is working within the narrative\\ndirections which they originated. This continuity in Tristram\\nShandy also extends to subject-matter and to methods\\n-293-\\nof characterisation, although in equally paradoxical ways. One of\\nSterne\\'s major themes, for example, is very similar to\\nRichardson\\'s central preoccupation: Uncle Toby is as much an\\nembodiment of the eighteenth-century conception of ideal\\ngoodness as Clarissa, but at the same time Fielding\\'s criticism of\\nRichardson is implicit in the way that Sterne\\'s masculine\\nembodiment of sexual virtue is pitted against the Widow\\nWadman\\'s villainous Lovelace. In characterisation, also, Tristram\\nShandy shows a very personal combination of the distinctive\\n299\\nemphases of Richardson and Fielding. On the surface it would\\nseem that since the hero\\'s consciousness is the locus of the\\naction, Sterne must be classed as an extreme exponent of the\\ninternal and subjective approach to character, an approach, of\\ncourse, which normally accompanies minute particularity in\\nnarrative method. Actually, however, although the behaviour of\\nthe main persons of the story is often rendered with a studied\\nattention to every inflection of thought and act, they themselves\\nare fundamentally conceived as general social and psychological\\ntypes, much in Fielding\\'s manner.\\nTristram Shandy, then, suggests that just as the author\\'s\\nfreedom to suggest an evaluation of the picture of life which his\\nnovel presents need not detract from its appearance of\\nauthenticity, so there is no absolute dichotomy between the\\ninternal and the external approach to character. This issue is of\\nconsiderable general importance, since the tendency to make an\\nabsolute separation between \\'characters of nature\\' and\\n\\'characters of manners\\' is the eighteenth-century form of a later\\ntendency to equate \\'realism\\' in the novel with an emphasis on\\nsociety rather than the individual, and to regard those novelists\\nwho explore the inner lives of their characters as outside the\\nmain realist tradition. That this distinction in the approach to\\ncharacter is an important one cannot be denied, and it is\\nunderstandable that the literary perspective of the French\\nRealists should so have coloured our sense of the term that we\\nfeel that if Balzac is a \\'realist\\' Proust needs some other word to\\ndescribe him. Nevertheless the basic continuity of the tradition of\\nthe novel is made clearer if we remember that these differences\\nin narrative method are differences of emphasis rather than of\\nkind, and that they exist within a common allegiance to the\\nformal or presentational realism which, it has been argued\\nabove, is typical of the novel genre as a whole.\\n-294-\\nThis particular critical problem has a close epistemological\\nanalogue -- dualism. It is significant that it was Descartes, the\\nfounder of modern philosophical realism, who raised the dualist\\nissue and made it one of the characteristic preoccupations of the\\nthought of the last three centuries. The two philosophical\\nproblems, of course, are closely related, since the\\nepistemological bent of seventeenth-century philosophy naturally\\ntended to focus attention on the problem of how the individual\\nmind can know anything that is external to itself. But although\\ndualism dramatises the opposition between different ways of\\nlooking at reality it does not, in fact, lead to any complete\\n311\\nrejection of the reality either of the ego or of the external world.\\nSimilarly, although different novelists have given different\\ndegrees of importance to the internal and the external objects of\\nconsciousness, they have never completely rejected either; on\\nthe contrary, the basic terms of their inquiry have been dictated\\nby the narrative equivalent of dualism -- the problematic nature\\nof the relation between the individual and his environment.\\nDefoe would seem to occupy a very central position between the\\nsubjective and the external orientations of the novelist: the\\nindividual ego and the material world, as the result of Defoe\\'s\\nuse of formal realism, are both given a greater reality in his\\nnovels than in previous fiction. Indeed the fact that his narrative\\npoint of view, that of the autobiographical memoir, shows itself\\nto be so well suited to reflect the tension between the inner and\\nthe outer world, suggests that the Cartesian shift to the point of\\nview of the perceiving individual ego was itself calculated to\\nmake possible a more sharply defined picture of the outer as well\\nas of the inner world.\\nLater novelists, of course, have exhibited very divergent\\napproaches to this duality, but it is significant that even those\\nwho, from Richardson onwards, have laid the greatest stress on\\nthe subjective and psychological direction, have also made some\\nof the greatest contributions both to the development of the\\npossibilities of formal realism and to the portrayal of society.\\nProust, for example, gives us, among other things, a document\\nof Cartesian introspection; but it is an introspection which\\nreveals the external world of the Third Republic as tellingly as\\nthe internal world of the memories of the narrator. Henry\\nJames\\'s technical triumphs can be seen as the result of an\\ningenious manipulation of the two dualist extremes: in the later\\nnovels\\n-295-\\nthe reader is absorbed into the subjective consciousness of one\\nor more of the characters, and from that artfully selected point of\\ndisadvantage beholds obliquely and ironically unfolded the vision\\nof the external social facts, the furies of money, class and culture\\nwhich are the ultimate determinants of subjective experience\\nalthough hardly glimpsed by their human agents and only fully\\nrecognised by the reader when the story is done. Joyce\\'s\\nUlysses, which is in so many ways the climax of the novel\\'s\\ndevelopment, is certainly its climax in the treatment of the\\ndualist extremes: in its last two books the graphic presentation\\nof Molly Bloom\\'s daydream and the cataloguing of the contents\\n311\\nof her husband\\'s drawers are defiantly unadulterated examples\\nof the adjustment of narrative manner to the subjective and the\\nobjective poles of dualism.\\nThe example of Sterne, then, and the analogy of philosophical\\ndualism, tend to support the view that the two major differences\\nof narrative method between the novels of Richardson and\\nFielding are by no means manifestations of two opposite and\\nirreconcilable kinds of novel, but merely rather clearly contrasted\\nsolutions of problems which pervade the whole tradition of the\\nnovel and whose apparent divergencies can in fact be\\nharmoniously reconciled. Indeed, the full maturity of the genre\\nitself, it can be argued, could only come when this reconciliation\\nhad been achieved, and it is probable that it is largely to her\\nsuccessful resolution of these problems that Jane Austen owes\\nher eminence in the tradition of the English novel.\\nIn this as in much else Jane Austen was the heir of Fanny\\nBurney, herself no inconsiderable figure in bringing together the\\ndivergent directions which the geniuses of Richardson and\\nFielding had imposed upon the novel. Both women novelists\\nfollowed Richardson -- the Richardson of the less intense\\ndomestic conflicts of Sir Charles Grandison -- in their minute\\npresentation of daily life. At the same time Fanny Burney and\\nJane Austen followed Fielding in adopting a more detached\\nattitude to their narrative material, and in evaluating it from a\\ncomic and objective point of view. It is here that Jane Austen\\'s\\ntechnical genius manifests itself. She dispensed with the\\nparticipating narrator, whether as the author of a memoir as in\\nDefoe, or as letterwriter as in Richardson, probably because both\\nof these roles make freedom to comment and evaluate more\\ndifficult to\\n-296-\\narrange; instead she told her stories after Fielding\\'s manner, as\\na confessed author. Jane Austen\\'s variant of the commenting\\nnarrator, however, was so much more discreet that it did not\\nsubstantially affect the authenticity of her narrative. Her\\nanalyses of her characters and their states of mind, and her\\nironical juxtapositions of motive and situation are as pointed as\\nanything in Fielding, but they do not seem to come from an\\nintrusive author but rather from some august and impersonal\\nspirit of social and psychological understanding.\\nAt the same time, Jane Austen varied her narrative point of view\\nsufficiently to give us, not only editorial comment, but much of\\n312\\nDefoe\\'s and Richardson\\'s psychological closeness to the\\nsubjective world of the characters. In her novels there is usually\\none character whose consciousness is tacitly accorded a\\nprivileged status, and whose mental life is rendered more\\ncompletely than that of the other characters. In Pride and\\nPrejudice (published 1813), for example, the story is told\\nsubstantially from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennet, the\\nheroine; but the identification is always qualified by the other\\nrole of the narrator acting as dispassionate analyst, and as a\\nresult the reader does not lose his critical awareness of the novel\\nas a whole. The same strategy as regards point of view is\\nemployed with supreme brilliance in Emma ( 1816), a novel\\nwhich combines Fielding\\'s characteristic strength in conveying\\nthe sense of society as a whole, with something of Henry James\\'s\\ncapacity for locating the essential structural continuity of his\\nnovel in the reader\\'s growing awareness of the full complexity of\\nthe personality and situation of the character through whom the\\nstory is mainly told: the unfolding of Emma Woodhouse\\'s inner\\nbeing has much of the drama of progressive revelation with\\nwhich James presents Maisie Farange or Lambert Strether.\\nJane Austen\\'s novels, in short, must be seen as the most\\nsuccessful solutions of the two general narrative problems for\\nwhich Richardson and Fielding had provided only partial answers.\\nShe was able to combine into a harmonious unity the advantages\\nboth of realism of presentation and realism of assessment, of the\\ninternal and of the external approaches to character; her novels\\nhave authenticity without diffuseness or trickery, wisdom of\\nsocial comment without a garrulous essayist, and a sense of the\\nsocial order which is not achieved at the expense of the\\nindividuality and autonomy of the characters.\\n-297-\\nJane Austen\\'s novels are also the climax of many other aspects\\nof the eighteenth-century novel. In their subjects, despite some\\nobvious differences, they continue many of the characteristic\\ninterests of Defoe, Richardson and Fielding. Jane Austen faces\\nmore squarely than Defoe, for example, the social and moral\\nproblems raised by economic individualism and the middle-class\\nquest for improved status; she follows Richardson in basing her\\nnovels on marriage and especially on the proper feminine role in\\nthe matter; and her ultimate picture of the proper norms of the\\nsocial system is similar to that of Fielding although its application\\nto the characters and their situation is in general more serious\\nand discriminating.\\n313\\nJane Austen\\'s novels are also representative in another sense;\\nthey reflect the process whereby, as we have seen, women were\\nplaying an increasingly important part in the literary scene. The\\nmajority of eighteenth-century novels were actually written by\\nwomen, but this had long remained a purely quantitative\\nassertion of dominance; it was Jane Austen who completed the\\nwork that Fanny Burney had begun, and challenged masculine\\nprerogative in a much more important matter. Her example\\nsuggests that the feminine sensibility was in some ways better\\nequipped to reveal the intricacies of personal relationships and\\nwas therefore at a real advantage in the realm of the novel. The\\nreasons for the greater feminine command of the area of\\npersonal relationships would be difficult and lengthy to detail;\\none of the main ones is probably that suggested by John Stuart\\nMill\\'s statement that \\'all the education that women receive from\\nsociety inculcates in them the feeling that the individuals\\nconnected with them are the only ones to whom they owe any\\nduty\\'. 1 As to the connection of this with the novel, there can\\nsurely be little doubt. Henry James, for example, alluded to it in\\na tribute which is characteristic in its scrupulous moderation:\\n\\'Women are delicate and patient observers; they hold their noses\\nclose, as it were, to the texture of life. They feel and perceive the\\nreal with a kind of personal tact, and their observations are\\nrecorded in a thousand delightful volumes.\\' 2 More generally,\\nJames elsewhere linked the \\'immensely great con-\\n____________________\\n1 T he Subjection of Women ( London, 1924), p. 105.\\n2 A nthony Trollope\\', Partial Portraits ( London, 1888), p. 50.

At the\\nsame time it is surely true that the dominance of women readers\\nin the public for the novel is connected with the characteristic\\nkind of weakness and unreality to which the form is liable -- its\\ntendency to restrict the field on which its psychological and\\nintellectual discriminations operate to a small and arbitrary\\n314\\nselection of human situations, a restriction which, since Fielding,\\nhas affected all but a very few English novels with a certain\\nnarrowing of the framework of experience and permitted\\nattitude.\\nThere is, then, a real continuity both in narrative method and in\\nsocial background between the early eighteenth-century\\nnovelists and their major successors. As a result, although one\\ncannot properly speak of a school of eighteenth-century\\nnovelists, one can, by adopting a larger perspective and\\ncomparing them either with any previous writers of fiction or\\nwith their contemporaries abroad, see that they constitute a\\nliterary movement whose members had a good deal in common.\\nThis kinship was very evident to the early nineteenth-century\\ncritics of the novel: Hazlitt, for example, tended to see\\nRichardson, Fielding and Sterne as alike in their unprecedented\\nfidelity to \\'human nature as it is\\'. 2 The family resemblance was\\nseen even more clearly abroad. In France, as George Saintsbury\\npointed out, the relation between literature and life in fiction\\nremained much more distant and formal throughout the\\neighteenth century. 3 Consequently English pre-eminence in the\\ngenre was freely granted from the middle of the century\\nonwards, with Fielding, Sterne and, above all, Richardson as the\\nmajor figures: Diderot even expressed a wish that some new\\nname could be found to distinguish the novels of Richardson\\nfrom the \\'romans\\' of his native tradition; 4 and for many French\\nand German readers the great differences between Richardson\\nand\\n____________________\\n1 \" Mrs. Humphry Ward\", Essays in London ( London, 1893), p.\\n265.\\n2 S ee Charles I.

Thus the first important study of the novel in its\\nlarger social background, Madame de Staël De la littérature,\\nconsidérée dans ses rapports avec les institutions sociales (\\n1800), anticipated many of the elements of the present analysis;\\n2 while de Bonald, who seems to have been the first critic to use\\nthe formula \\'La littérature est l\\'expression de la société\\',\\npresented a substantially similar picture of the historical causes\\nof the accepted English eminence in the novel in his Du style et\\nde la littérature ( 1806). He took it for granted that the novel\\nwas essentially concerned with private and domestic life: what\\ncould be more natural, therefore, than that a distinctively\\ncommercial, bourgeois and urban society which laid so much\\nstress on family life, and which was, moreover, so notoriously\\npoor in the nobler forms of literary expression, should have\\ntriumphed in a familiar and domestic genre. 3\\nThe course of French literature provides confirmation of another\\nkind as to the importance both of the social and the literary\\nfactors whose connection with the early development of the\\nnovel in England has been presented here. The first great\\nefflorescence of the genre in France which began with Balzac and\\nStendhal occurred only after the French Revolution had placed\\nthe French middle class in a position of social and literary power\\nwhich their English counterparts had achieved exactly a century\\nbefore in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. And if Balzac and\\nStendhal are greater figures in the tradition of the European\\nnovel than any English novelist of the eighteenth century, it is\\nsurely in part due to the historical advantages which they\\nenjoyed: not only because the social changes with which they\\nwere concerned had found much more dramatic expression than\\nin England, but because, on the literary side, they\\n____________________\\n1 S ee, for example, L.

In\\nthe Preface to the Lyrical Ballads ( 1800), for example,\\nWordsworth proclaimed that the writer must \\'keep his eye on the\\nobject\\' and present the experiences of common life in \\'the real\\nlanguage of men\\'; while the French break with the literary past\\nfound its most dramatic expression with the presentation of\\nHernani ( 1830) where Victor Hugo defied the hallowed decorums\\nwhich restricted the manner in which the literary object was\\nsupposed to be portrayed.\\nSuch are some of the larger literary perspectives which the early\\neighteenth-century novelists suggest. Compared with Jane\\nAusten, or with Balzac and Stendhal, Defoe, Richardson and\\nFielding all have fairly obvious technical weaknesses. Historically,\\nhowever, they have two kinds of importance: the obvious\\nimportance that attaches to writers who made the major\\ncontribution to the creation of the dominant literary form of the\\nlast two centuries; and the equally great importance which arises\\nfrom the fact that, assisted, no doubt, by the fact that they were\\nessentially independent innovators, their novels provide three\\nrather sharply defined images of the form in general, and\\nconstitute a remarkably complete recapitulation of the essential\\ndiversities in its later tradition. They also, of course, make a\\nmore absolute claim upon us. In the novel, more perhaps than in\\nany other literary genre, the qualities of life can atone for the\\ndefects of art: and there can be little doubt that Defoe,\\nRichardson and Fielding all earned themselves a more secure\\nliterary immortality than many later novelists who were\\npossessed of much greater technical sophistication, by\\nexpressing their own sense of life with a completeness and\\nconviction which is very rare, and for which one is grateful.'"
