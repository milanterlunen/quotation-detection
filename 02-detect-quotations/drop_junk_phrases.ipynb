    "## Description of Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook is to drop phrases from the results output in phase 02 that are detected by matcher as quotations but are not in fact quotations. Examples of this can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- coincidental repetition of common words (e.g. \"the question is whether\")\n",
    "- multi-word idioms (e.g. \"at the end of the day\")\n",
    "- multi-word names, e.g.\n",
    "    - place names: \"Place de la Concorde\"\n",
    "    - names of people: \"Jos√© Ortega y Gasset\"\n",
    "    - names of books: \"Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison\"\n",
    "    - names of publishers: \"Johns Hopkins University\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook guides the user through identifying what counts as junk phrases and removing them from the full results JSONL file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook saves a list of dropped junk phrases, in case the user needs to repeat the process, check what was dropped, or add additional junk phrases to remove later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook prioritizes the most frequently repeating junk phrases, since these are likely to skew the results most intensely. Low-frequency junk phrases are probably not worth removing one by one."

Is there any other area of Romanticism that can match the excitement of Romantic theater studies at this particular moment in time? In the past decade a window upon a lost world has been partially opened by theater historians, drama critics, and textual editors who have increased our understanding of actors and actresses, staging, closet theater, military theater, illegitimate theater, theater censorship, Gothic drama, melodrama, and Shakespeare idolatry.
