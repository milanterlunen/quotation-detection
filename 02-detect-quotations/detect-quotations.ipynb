    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">It would seem, however, that if analysis seeks to be exhaustive (and what </span><span class=\"c-2\">would any method be worth which did not account for the totality of its object, i.e., in this case, of the entire surface of the narrative fabric?</span><span class=\"c-0\">), if it seeks to encompass the </span><span class=\"c-1\">absolute detail, the indivisible unit,</span><span class=\"c-0\"> the fugitive transition, in </span><span class=\"c-1\">order to assign them a place in the structure,</span><span class=\"c-0\"> it inevitably encounters notations which no </span><span class=\"c-1\">function (not even the most indirect) can justify: such notations are scandalous (from the point of view of structure), or, what is even more disturbing, they seem to </span><span class=\"c-2\">correspond to a kind of </span><span class=\"c-3\">narrative luxury, lavish to the point of offering many \"futile\" details and thereby </span><span class=\"c-4\">increasing the cost of narrative information.</span><span class=\"c-0\"> For if, in Flaubert's description, it is just</p>\n",

Even if they are not numerous, the \"useless details\" therefore seem inevitable: every narrative, at least every </span><span class=\"c-1\">Western narrative of the ordinary sort </span><span class=\"c-0\">nowadays, possesses a certain number. </p>\n",

    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">Insignificant notation* (taking this word in its stong sense: </span><span class=\"c-2\">apparently detached from the narrative's semiotic </span><span class=\"c-1\">structure)</span><span class=\"c-0\"> is related to description, even if the object seems to be denoted only by a single word (in reality, the \"pure\" word does not exist: Flaubert's barometer is not cited in isolation; it is located, placed in a syntagm at once referential and syntactic); thus is underlined the </span><span class=\"c-1\">enigmatic character of all description,</span><span class=\"c-0\"> about which a word is necessary: the general structure of narrative, at least as it has been occasionally analyzed till now, appears as essentially predictive; schematizing to the extreme, and without taking into account numerous detours, delays, reversals, and disappointments which narrative institutionally imposes upon this schema, we can </span><span class=\"c-1\">say that, at each articulation of the narrative syntagm, someone says to the hero (or to the reader,</span><span class=\"c-0\"> it does not matter which): if you act in this way, if you choose this </span><span class=\"c-1\">alternative, this is what will happen </span><span class=\"c-0\">(the reported character of these predictions does not call into question their practical nature).

    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">* In this brief account, we shall not give examples of \"insignificant\" notations, for the insignificant can be revealed only on the level of an immense structure: once cited, a notion is neither significant nor insignificant; it requires an already analyzed context. </p>\n",

    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">is entirely different: it has no predictive mark; \"analogical,\" its </span><span class=\"c-2\">structure is purely summatory and does not contain that trajectory of choices and alternatives which gives narration </span><span class=\"c-1\">the appearance of a huge traffic-control center,</span><span class=\"c-0\"> furnished with a referential (and not merely discursive) temporality. This is an opposition which, anthropologically, has its importance: when, under the influence of von Frisch's experiments, it was assumed that bees had a language, it had to be realized that, while these insects possessed a predictive system of dances (in order to collect their food), nothing in it approached a description. Thus, description appears as a kind of characteristic of the so-called higher languages, to the apparently paradoxical degree that it is justified by no finality of action or of communication. The </span><span class=\"c-1\">singularity of description (or of the \"useless detail\") in narrative fabric, its isolated situation, designates a question which has the greatest importance for the </span><span class=\"c-5\">structural analysis of narrative. This </span><span class=\"c-2\">question </span><span class=\"c-1\">is the following: Is </span><span class=\"c-2\">everything in narrative significant, and if not, if insignificant stretches subsist in the narrative syntagm, what is </span><span class=\"c-3\">ultimately, so to speak, the significance of this insignificance?</span><span class=\"c-0\"> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></span><span class=\"c-1\">First of all, we must recall </span><span class=\"c-0\">that Western culture, in one of its major currents, has certainly not left description outside meaning, and has furnished it with a finality quite \"recognized\" by the literary institution. This current is Rhetoric, and this finality is that of the \"beautiful\": description has long had an aesthetic function. Very early in antiquity, to the two expressly functional genres of discourse, legal and political, was added a third, the epideictic, a ceremonial discourse intended to excite the admiration of the audience (and no longer to persuade it); this discourse contained in germ - whatever the ritual rules of its use: eulogy or obituary - the very idea of an aesthetic finality of language; in the Alexandrian neo-rhetoric of the second century A.D., there was a craze for ecphrasis, the detachable set piece (thus having its end in itself, independent of any general function), whose object was to describe places, times, people, or works of art, a tradition which was maintained throughout the </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">\n",
    "144 </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">Middle Ages. As Curtius has emphasized, description in this period is constrained by no realism; its truth is unimportant (or even its verisimilitude); there is no hesitation to put lions or olive trees in a northern country; only the constraint of the descriptive genre counts; </span><span class=\"c-1\">plausibility is not referential here but openly discursive:</span><span class=\"c-0\"> it is the generic rules of discourse which lay down the law. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">Moving ahead to Flaubert, we see that the aesthetic purpose of description is still very strong. In Madame Bovary, the description of Rouen (a real referent if ever there was one) is subject to the tyrannical constraints of what we must call aesthetic verisimilitude, as is attested by the corrections made in this passage in the course of six successive rewritings. Here we see, first of all, that the corrections do not in any way issue from a closer consideration of the model: Rouen, perceived by Flaubert, remains just the same, or more precisely, if it changes somewhat from one version to the next, it is solely because he finds it necessary to focus an image or avoid a phonic redundance condemned by the rules of le beau style, or again to \"arrange\" a quite contingent felicity of expression;* next we see that the descriptive fabric, which at first glance seems to grant a major importance (by its dimension, by the concern for its detail) to the object Rouen, is in fact only a </span><span class=\"c-1\">sort of setting meant to receive the </span><span class=\"c-2\">jewels of a number of rare metaphors,</span><span class=\"c-1\"> the neutral, prosaic excipient which swathes the precious symbolic substance, as if, in Rouen, all that mattered were the figures of rhetoric to which the sight of the city lends itself — as if Rouen were notable only by its substitutions </span><span class=\"c-0\">(the masts like a forest of needles, the islands like huge motionless black fish, the clouds like aerial waves silently breaking against a cliff); last, we see that the whole description is constructed so as to connect Rouen to a painting: it is a painted scene which the language takes up (\"</span><span class=\"c-1\">Thus, seen from above, the whole </span><span class=\"c-0\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">* A mechanism distinguished by Valéry, in Littérature, commenting on Baudelaire's line \"</span><span class=\"c-6\">La servante au grand </span><span class=\"c-1\">coeur </span><span class=\"c-0\">. . .\": \"This line came to Baudelaire ... And Baudelaire continued. He buried the cook out on the lawn, which goes against the custom, but goes with the rhyme,\" etc. </p>\n",

    "145 </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">landscape had the motionless look of a painting\"); the writer here fulfills Plato's definition of the artist as a maker in the third degree, since he </span><span class=\"c-1\">imitates what is already the simulation of an essence.</span><span class=\"c-0\"> Thus, although the description of Rouen is quite irrelevant to the </span><span class=\"c-2\">narrative structure of Madame Bovary </span><span class=\"c-0\">(we can attach it to no functional sequence nor to any characterial, atmospheric, or sapiential signified), it is not in the least scandalous, it is justified, if not by the work's logic, at least by the laws of literature: its \"meaning\" exists, it depends on conformity not to the model but to the cultural rules of representation. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">All the same, the aesthetic goal of Flaubertian description is thoroughly mixed with \"realistic\" imperatives, as if the referent's exactitude, superior or indifferent to any other function, governed and alone justified its description, or - in the case of descriptions reduced to a single word - its denotation: here aesthetic constraints are steeped - at least as an alibi - in referential constraints: it is likely that, if one came to Rouen in a diligence, the view one would have coming down the slope leading to the town would not be \"objectively\" different from the panorama Flaubert describes. This mixture - this interweaving - of constraints has a double advantage: on the one hand, aesthetic function, giving a meaning to \"the fragment,\" </span><span class=\"c-1\">halts what we might call the </span><span class=\"c-2\">vertigo </span><span class=\"c-1\">of notation; for once, </span><span class=\"c-2\">discourse is no longer guided and limited by structural imperatives </span><span class=\"c-0\">of the anecdote (functions and indices), </span><span class=\"c-1\">nothing could indicate why we should halt the details of the description here and not there;</span><span class=\"c-0\"> if it </span><span class=\"c-1\">were not </span><span class=\"c-2\">subject to an </span><span class=\"c-3\">aesthetic or rhetorical choice, any \"view\"</span><span class=\"c-2\"> would </span><span class=\"c-1\">be inexhaustible by discourse: there </span><span class=\"c-2\">would always </span><span class=\"c-1\">be a corner, a detail, an inflection of space </span><span class=\"c-0\">or color to report; on the other hand, by </span><span class=\"c-3\">positing the referential as real, by pretending to follow it in a submissive fashion,</span><span class=\"c-2\"> realistic description avoids being reduced to fantasmatic activity (a precaution which was supposed necessary to the \"objectivity\" of the account)</span><span class=\"c-0\">; classical rhetoric had in a sense institutionalized the fantasmatic as a specific figure, hypotyposis, whose function was to \"put things before the hearer's eyes,\" not in a neutral, </p>\n",

    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">constative manner, but by imparting to representation all the luster of desire (this was the vividly illuminated sector of discourse, with prismatic outlines: illustris oratio); declaratively renouncing the constraints of the rhetorical code, realism must seek a new reason to describe. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">The </span><span class=\"c-2\">irreducible </span><span class=\"c-3\">residues of functional analysis </span><span class=\"c-2\">have this in common: they denote what is ordinarily called \"concrete </span><span class=\"c-1\">reality\" (</span><span class=\"c-2\">insignificant </span><span class=\"c-3\">gestures, </span><span class=\"c-4\">transitory attitudes, insignificant objects, redundant words)</span><span class=\"c-2\">. The pure and simple \"representation\" of the \"real,</span><span class=\"c-1\">\" the naked relation of \"what is\" (or has been) </span><span class=\"c-3\">thus appears as a resistance to meaning;</span><span class=\"c-2\"> this resistance </span><span class=\"c-3\">confirms the great mythic opposition of the true-</span><span class=\"c-2\">to-life (the lifelike) and the intelligible;</span><span class=\"c-0\"> it suffices to recall that, in the ideology of our time, obsessive reference to the \"concrete\" (in what is rhetorically demanded of the human sciences, of literature, of behavior) is always brandished like a weapon against meaning, as if, by </span><span class=\"c-1\">some statutory exclusion, what is </span><span class=\"c-2\">alive cannot not signify - and vice versa.</span><span class=\"c-0\"> Resistance of the \"real\" (in its written form, of course) to structure is very limited in the fictive account, constructed by definition on a model which, for its main outlines, has no other constraints than those of intelligibility; but this same \"reality\" </span><span class=\"c-1\">becomes the essential reference in historical narrative, which is supposed to report \"what really happened\"</span><span class=\"c-0\">: what does the non-functionality of a detail matter then, once it denotes \"what took place\"; \"concrete reality\" becomes the sufficient justification for speaking. </span><span class=\"c-1\">History (historical </span><span class=\"c-2\">discourse: historia rerum gestarum)</span><span class=\"c-1\"> is in fact the model of those narratives which consent to fill in the interstices of their functions by structurally superfluous notations, and it is </span><span class=\"c-2\">logical that literary realism should have </span><span class=\"c-1\">been - give or take a few decades - contemporary with the regnum of \"objective\"</span><span class=\"c-0\"> </span><span class=\"c-1\">history, to which must be added the contemporary development of techniques, of works, and institutions based </span><span class=\"c-0\">on the </span><span class=\"c-1\">incessant need to authenticate the \"real\"</span><span class=\"c-0\">: the photograph (immediate witness of \"what was here\"), reportage, exhibitions of ancient objects (the success of the Tutankhamen </span><span class=\"c-1\">show </span><span class=\"c-12\">makes this quite clear)</span><span class=\"c-0\">, the </span><span class=\"c-1\">tourism of monuments and historical sites.</span><span class=\"c-0\"> </p>\n",

    "147 </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></span><span class=\"c-1\">All this shows that the \"</span><span class=\"c-2\">real\" is supposed to be self-sufficient,</span><span class=\"c-1\"> that it is strong enough to belie any notion of \"function,\" that its \"speech-act\" has no need to be integrated into a structure and that the </span><span class=\"c-2\">having-been-there of things is a sufficient </span><span class=\"c-1\">principle of speech.</span><span class=\"c-0\"> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-0\">Since antiquity, the \"real\" has been on History's side; but this was to help it oppose the \"lifelike,\" the \"plausible,\" to oppose the very order of narrative (of </span><span class=\"c-1\">imitation or \"poetry\"). All classical culture lived for centuries on the notion that reality could in no way contaminate verisimilitude;</span><span class=\"c-0\"> first of all, because verisimilitude is never anything but opinable: it is entirely subject to (public) opinion; as Nicole said: \"One must not consider </span><span class=\"c-1\">things as they are in themselves, nor as they are </span><span class=\"c-0\">known to be by one who speaks or writes, but only in relation to what is known of them by those who read or hear\"; then, because History was thought to be general, not particular (whence the propensity, in classical texts, to functionalize all details, to produce strong structures and to justify no notation by the mere guarantee of \"reality\"); finally, because, in verisimilitude, the contrary is never impossible, since notation rests on a majority, but not an absolute, opinion. The motto implicit on the threshold of all classical discourse (subject to the ancient idea of verisimilitude) is: </span><span class=\"c-1\">Esto (Let there be, suppose.</span><span class=\"c-0\">..) \"Real,\" fragmented, interstitial notation, the kind we are dealing with here, renounces this implicit introduction, and it is free of any such postulation that occurs in the structural fabric. Hence, there is a break between the ancient mode of versimilitude and modern realism; but hence, too, a new verisimilitude is born, which is precisely realism (by which we mean any discourse which accepts \"speech-acts\" justified by their referent alone). </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></span><span class=\"c-1\">Semiotically, the \"</span><span class=\"c-2\">concrete detail\" is constituted by the </span><span class=\"c-6\">direct collusion of a referent and a signifier;</span><span class=\"c-4\"> the signified is expelled from the sign,</span><span class=\"c-2\"> and with it, of course, the possibility of developing a form of the signified, i.e., narrative structure </span><span class=\"c-1\">itself.

    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"c-1\">This </span><span class=\"c-0\">new verisimilitude is very different from the old one, for it is neither a respect for the \"laws of the genre\" nor </span><span class=\"c-1\">even their mask, but proceeds from the intention to degrade the sign's tripartite nature in order to make notation the pure encounter of an object and its expression.</span><span class=\"c-0\"> The disintegration of the sign — which seems indeed to be modernity's grand affair - is of course present in the realistic enterprise, but in a somewhat regressive manner, since it occurs in the name of a referential plenitude, whereas the goal today is to empty the sign and infinitely to postpone its object so as to challenge, in a radical fashion, the age-old aesthetic of \"representation.\" </p>\n",
