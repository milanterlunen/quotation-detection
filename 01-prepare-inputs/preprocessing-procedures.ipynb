The\\ntools that enable historians to carry out this work of analysis are partly\\ninherited and partly of their own making: models of economic growth,\\nquantitative analysis of market movements, accounts of demographic\\nexpansion and contraction, the study of climate and its long-term\\nchanges, the fixing of sociological constants, the description of techno-\\nlogical adjustments and of their spread and continuity. These tools have\\nenabled workers in the historical field to distinguish various sediment-\\nary strata; linear successions, which for so long had been the object of\\nresearch, have given way to discoveries in depth. From the political\\nmobility at the surface down to the slow movements of ‘material civil-\\nization’, ever more levels of analysis have been established: each has its\\nown peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the\\ndeepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly\\n~indexed_page_number:9~\\n\\n4 the archaeology of knowledge\\nchanging history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge\\nother, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the\\nhistory of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irriga-\\ntion, the history of crop rotation, the history of the balance achieved by\\nthe human species between hunger and abundance. The old questions\\nof the traditional analysis (What link should be made between dispar-\\nate events? How can a causal succession be established between them?\\nWhat continuity or overall significance do they possess? Is it possible to\\ndefine a totality, or must one be content with reconstituting con-\\nnexions?)',\n",
       " ': which\\nstrata should be isolated from others? What types of series should be\\nestablished? What criteria of periodization should be adopted for each\\nof them? What system of relations (hierarchy, dominance, stratifica-\\ntion, univocal determination, circular causality)',\n",
       " ': they suspend the continuous accumulation of knowledge,\\ninterrupt its slow development, and force it to enter a new time, cut it\\noff from its empirical origin and its original motivations, cleanse it of\\nits imaginary complicities; they direct historical analysis away from the\\nsearch for silent beginnings, and the never-ending tracing-back to the\\noriginal precursors, towards the search for a new type of rationality\\n\\n~printed_page_number:4~\\n~indexed_page_number:10~\\n\\nintroduction 5\\nand its various effects. There are the displacements and transformations of\\nconcepts: the analyses of G. Canguilhem may serve as models; they\\nshow that the history of a concept is not wholly and entirely that of its\\nprogressive refinement, its continuously increasing rationality, its\\nabstraction gradient, but that of its various fields of constitution and\\nvalidity, that of its successive rules of use, that of the many theoretical\\ncontexts in which it developed and matured. There is the distinction,\\nwhich we also owe to Canguilhem, between the microscopic and macro-\\nscopic scales of the history of the sciences, in which events and their\\nconsequences are not arranged in the same way: thus a discovery, the\\ndevelopment of a method, the achievements, and the failures, of a\\nparticular scientist, do not have the same incidence, and cannot be\\ndescribed in the same way at both levels; on each of the two levels, a\\ndifferent history is being written. Recurrent redistributions reveal several\\npasts, several forms of connexion, several hierarchies of importance,\\nseveral networks of determination, several teleologies, for one and the\\nsame science, as its present undergoes change: thus historical descrip-\\ntions are necessarily ordered by the present state of knowledge, they\\nincrease with every transformation and never cease, in turn, to break\\nwith themselves (in the field of mathematics, M. Serres has provided\\nthe theory of this phenomenon)',\n",
       " ':5~\\n~indexed_page_number:11~\\n\\n6 the archaeology of knowledge\\nhorizon, what mode of action and what substructure is implied by the\\ninterplay of transmissions, resumptions, disappearances, and repeti-\\ntions, how the origin may extend its sway well beyond itself to that\\nconclusion that is never given – the problem is no longer one of\\ntradition, of tracing a line, but one of division, of limits; it is no longer\\none of lasting foundations, but one of transformations that serve as\\nnew foundations, the rebuilding of foundations. What one is seeing,\\nthen, is the emergence of a whole field of questions, some of which are\\nalready familiar, by which this new form of history is trying to develop\\nits own theory: how is one to specify the different concepts that enable\\nus to conceive of discontinuity (threshold, rupture, break, mutation,\\ntransformation)',\n",
       " ': the questioning of the document. Of course, it is\\nobvious enough that ever since a discipline such as history has existed,\\n\\n~printed_page_number:6~\\n~indexed_page_number:12~\\n\\nintroduction 7\\ndocuments have been used, questioned, and have given rise to ques-\\ntions; scholars have asked not only what these documents meant, but\\nalso whether they were telling the truth, and by what right they could\\nclaim to be doing so, whether they were sincere or deliberately mis-\\nleading, well informed or ignorant, authentic or tampered with. But\\neach of these questions, and all this critical concern, pointed to one and\\nthe same end: the reconstitution, on the basis of what the documents\\nsay, and sometimes merely hint at, of the past from which they eman-\\nate and which has now disappeared far behind them; the document\\nwas always treated as the language of a voice since reduced to silence,\\nits fragile, but possibly decipherable trace. Now, through a mutation\\nthat is not of very recent origin, but which has still not come to an end,\\nhistory has altered its position in relation to the document: it has taken\\nas its primary task, not the interpretation of the document, nor the\\nattempt to decide whether it is telling the truth or what is its expressive\\nvalue, but to work on it from within and to develop it: history now\\norganizes the document, divides it up, distributes it, orders it, arranges\\nit in levels, establishes series, distinguishes between what is relevant\\nand what is not, discovers elements, defines unities, describes relations.\\nThe document, then, is no longer for history an inert material through\\nwhich it tries to reconstitute what men have done or said, the events of\\nwhich only the trace remains; history is now trying to define within\\nthe documentary material itself unities, totalities, series, relations. His-\\ntory must be detached from the image that satisfied it for so long, and\\nthrough which it found its anthropological justification: that of an age-\\nold collective consciousness that made use of material documents to\\nrefresh its memory; history is the work expended on material docu-\\nmentation (books, texts, accounts, registers, acts, buildings, institu-\\ntions, laws, techniques, objects, customs, etc.)',\n",

In that area where, in the past, history deciphered the\\ntraces left by men, it now deploys a mass of elements that have to be\\ngrouped, made relevant, placed in relation to one another to form\\ntotalities. There was a time when archaeology, as a discipline devoted\\nto silent monuments, inert traces, objects without context, and things\\nleft by the past, aspired to the condition of history, and attained\\nmeaning only through the restitution of a historical discourse; it might\\nbe said, to play on words a little, that in our time history aspires to\\nthe condition of archaeology, to the intrinsic description of the\\nmonument.\\nThis has several consequences. First of all, there is the surface effect\\nalready mentioned: the proliferation of discontinuities in the history of\\nideas, and the emergence of long periods in history proper. In fact, in\\nits traditional form, history proper was concerned to define relations\\n(of simple causality, of circular determination, of antagonism, of\\nexpression)',\n",
       " ': the series being known, it\\nwas simply a question of defining the position of each element in\\nrelation to the other elements in the series. The problem now is to\\nconstitute series: to define the elements proper to each series, to fix its\\nboundaries, to reveal its own specific type of relations, to formulate its\\nlaws, and, beyond this, to describe the relations between different\\nseries, thus constituting series of series, or ‘tables’: hence the\\never-increasing number of strata, and the need to distinguish them,\\nthe specificity of their time and chronologies; hence the need to\\ndistinguish not only important events (with a long chain of\\nconsequences)',\n",

In the history of ideas, of thought and of the sciences, the\\nsame mutation has brought about the opposite effect; it has broken up\\nthe long series formed by the progress of consciousness, or the tele-\\nology of reason, or the evolution of human thought; it has questioned\\nthe themes of convergence and culmination; it has doubted the possi-\\nbility of creating totalities. It has led to the individualization of differ-\\nent series, which are juxtaposed to one another, follow one another,\\noverlap and intersect, without one being able to reduce them to a liner\\nschema. Thus, in place of the continuous chronology of reason, which\\nwas invariably traced back to some inaccessible origin, there have\\nappeared scales that are sometimes very brief, distinct from one\\nanother, irreducible to a single law, scales that bear a type of history\\npeculiar to each one, and which cannot be reduced to the general\\nmodel of a consciousness that acquires, progresses, and remembers.\\nSecond consequence: the notion of discontinuity assumes a major\\nrole in the historical disciplines. For history in its classical form, the\\ndiscontinuous was both the given and the unthinkable: the raw\\nmaterial of history, which presented itself in the form of dispersed\\nevents – decisions, accidents, initiatives, discoveries; the material,\\nwhich, through analysis, had to be rearranged, reduced, effaced in\\norder to reveal the continuity of events. Discontinuity was the stigma of\\ntemporal dislocation that it was the historian’s task to remove from\\nhistory. It has now become one of the basic elements of historical\\nanalysis. Its role is threefold. First, it constitutes a deliberate operation\\non the part of the historian (and not a quality of the material with\\nwhich he has to deal)',\n",

The\\nnotion of discontinuity is a paradoxical one: because it is both an\\ninstrument and an object of research; because it divides up the field of\\nwhich it is the effect; because it enables the historian to individualize\\ndifferent domains but can be established only by comparing those\\ndomains. And because, in the final analysis, perhaps, it is not simply a\\nconcept present in the discourse of the historian, but something that\\nthe historian secretly supposes to be present: on what basis, in fact,\\ncould he speak without this discontinuity that offers him history – and\\nhis own history – as an object? One of the most essential features of the\\nnew history is probably this displacement of the discontinuous: its\\ntransference from the obstacle to the work itself; its integration into the\\ndiscourse of the historian, where it no longer plays the role of an\\nexternal condition that must be reduced, but that of a working concept;\\nand therefore the inversion of signs by which it is no longer the nega-\\ntive of the historical reading (its underside, its failure, the limit of\\nits power)',\n",
       " ': the theme and the possibility of a total history\\nbegin to disappear, and we see the emergence of something very dif-\\nferent that might be called a general history. The project of a total history\\nis one that seeks to reconstitute the overall form of a civilization, the\\nprinciple – material or spiritual – of a society, the significance com-\\nmon to all the phenomena of a period, the law that accounts for their\\ncohesion – what is called metaphorically the ‘face’ of a period. Such a\\nproject is linked to two or three hypotheses; it is supposed that between\\nall the events of a well-defined spatio-temporal area, between all the\\nphenomena of which traces have been found, it must be possible to\\nestablish a system of homogeneous relations: a network of causality\\nthat makes it possible to derive each of them, relations of analogy that\\nshow how they symbolize one another, or how they all express one and\\nthe same central core; it is also supposed that one and the same form of\\nhistoricity operates upon economic structures, social institutions and\\ncustoms, the inertia of mental attitudes, technological practice, polit-\\nical behaviour, and subjects them all to the same type of transform-\\nation; lastly, it is supposed that history itself may be articulated into\\n\\n~printed_page_number:10~\\n~indexed_page_number:16~\\n\\nintroduction 11\\ngreat units – stages or phases – which contain within themselves their\\nown principle of cohesion. These are the postulates that are challenged\\nby the new history when it speaks of series, divisions, limits, differ-\\nences of level, shifts, chronological specificities, particular forms of\\nrehandling, possible types of relation. This is not because it is trying to\\nobtain a plurality of histories juxtaposed and independent of one\\nanother: that of the economy beside that of institutions, and beside\\nthese two those of science, religion, or literature; nor is it because it is\\nmerely trying to discover between these different histories coinci-\\ndences of dates, or analogies of form and meaning. The problem that\\nnow presents itself – and which defines the task of a general history – is\\nto determine what form of relation may be legitimately described\\nbetween these different series; what vertical system they are capable of\\nforming; what interplay of correlation and dominance exists between\\nthem; what may be the effect of shifts, different temporalities, and\\nvarious rehandlings; in what distinct totalities certain elements may\\nfigure simultaneously; in short, not only what series, but also what\\n‘series of series’ – or, in other words, what ‘tables’ it is possible to draw\\nup. A total description draws all phenomena around a single centre – a\\nprinciple, a meaning, a spirit, a world-view, an overall shape; a general\\nhistory, on the contrary, would deploy the space of a dispersion.\\nFourth and last consequence: the new history is confronted by a\\nnumber of methodological problems, several of which, no doubt,\\nexisted long before the emergence of the new history, but which, taken\\ntogether, characterize it.

But it took a long time to have much effect. Even now –\\nand this is especially true in the case of the history of thought – it has\\nbeen neither registered nor reflected upon, while other, more recent\\ntransformations – those of linguistics, for example – have been. It is as\\nif it was particularly difficult, in the history in which men retrace their\\nown ideas and their own knowledge, to formulate a general theory of\\ndiscontinuity, of series, of limits, unities, specific orders, and differen-\\ntiated autonomies and dependences. As if, in that field where we had\\nbecome used to seeking origins, to pushing back further and further\\nthe line of antecedents, to reconstituting traditions, to following evo-\\nlutive curves, to projecting teleologies, and to having constant\\nrecourse to metaphors of life, we felt a particular repugnance to con-\\nceiving of difference, to describing separations and dispersions, to\\ndissociating the reassuring form of the identical. Or, to be more pre-\\ncise, as if we found it difficult to construct a theory, to draw general\\nconclusions, and even to derive all the possible implications of these\\nconcepts of thresholds, mutations, independent systems, and limited\\nseries – in the way in which they had been used in fact by historians.\\nAs if we were afraid to conceive of the Other in the time of our own\\nthought.\\nThere is a reason for this. If the history of thought could remain the\\nlocus of uninterrupted continuities, if it could endlessly forge con-\\nnexions that no analysis could undo without abstraction, if it could\\nweave, around everything that men say and do, obscure synthesis that\\nanticipate for him, prepare him, and lead him endlessly towards his\\nfuture, it would provide a privileged shelter for the sovereignty of\\nconsciousness. Continuous history is the indispensable correlative of\\nthe founding function of the subject: the guarantee that everything that\\nhas eluded him may be restored to him; the certainty that time will\\ndisperse nothing without restoring it in a reconstituted unity; the\\npromise that one day the subject – in the form of historical conscious-\\nness – will once again be able to appropriate, to bring back under his\\nsway, all those things that are kept at a distance by difference, and find\\nin them what might be called his abode. Making historical analysis the\\ndiscourse of the continuous and making human consciousness the\\noriginal subject of all historical development and all action are the two\\nsides of the same system of thought. In this system, time is conceived\\n\\n~printed_page_number:13~\\n~indexed_page_number:19~\\n\\n14 the archaeology of knowledge\\nin terms of totalization and revolutions are never more than moments\\nof consciousness.\\nIn various forms, this theme has played a constant role since the\\nnineteenth century: to preserve, against all decentrings, the sovereignty\\nof the subject, and the twin figures of anthropology and humanism.\\nAgainst the decentring operated by Marx – by the historical analysis of\\nthe relations of production, economic determinations, and the class\\nstruggle – it gave place, towards the end of the nineteenth century, to\\nthe search for a total history, in which all the differences of a society\\nmight be reduced to a single form, to the organization of a world-view,\\nto the establishment of a system of values, to a coherent type of civiliza-\\ntion. To the decentring operated by the Nietzschean genealogy, it\\nopposed the search for an original foundation that would make ration-\\nality the telos of mankind, and link the whole history of thought to the\\npreservation of this rationality, to the maintenance of this teleology,\\nand to the ever necessary return to this foundation. Lastly, more\\nrecently, when the researches of psychoanalysis, linguistics, and eth-\\nnology have decentred the subject in relation to the laws of his desire,\\nthe forms of his language, the rules of his action, or the games of his\\nmythical or fabulous discourse, when it became clear that man himself,\\nquestioned as to what he was, could not account for his sexuality and\\nhis unconscious, the systematic forms of his language, or the regular-\\nities of his fictions, the theme of a continuity of history has been\\nreactivated once again; a history that would be not division, but devel-\\nopment (devenir)',\n",

The question proper to such an analysis might be formu-\\nlated in this way: what is this specific existence that emerges from what\\nis said and nowhere else?\\nWe must ask ourselves what purpose is ultimately served by this\\nsuspension of all the accepted unities, if, in the end, we return to the\\nunities that we pretended to question at the outset.

I\\nhave been careful to accept as valid none of the unities that would\\nnormally present themselves to anyone embarking on such a task. I\\nhave decided to ignore no form of discontinuity, break, threshold, or\\nlimit. I have decided to describe statements in the field of discourse and\\nthe relations of which they are capable. As I see it, two series of prob-\\nlems arise at the outset: the first, which I shall leave to one side for the\\ntime being and shall return to later, concerns the indiscriminate use\\nthat I have made of the terms statement, event, and discourse; the\\nsecond concerns the relations that may legitimately be described\\nbetween the statements that have been left in their provisional, visible\\ngrouping.\\nThere are statements, for example, that are quite obviously con-\\ncerned – and have been from a date that is easy enough to determine –\\nwith political economy, or biology, or psychopathology; there are\\nothers that equally obviously belong to those age-old continuities\\nknown as grammar or medicine. But what are these unities? How can\\nwe say that the analysis of headaches carried out by Willis or Charcot\\nbelong to the same order of discourse? That Petty’s inventions are in\\ncontinuity with Neumann’s econometry? That the analysis of judge-\\nment by the Port-Royal grammarians belongs to the same domain as\\n~indexed_page_number:38~\\n\\ndiscursive formations 35\\nthe discovery of vowel gradations in the Indo-European languages?\\nWhat, in fact, are medicine, grammar, or political economy? Are they merely a\\nretrospective regrouping by which the contemporary sciences deceive\\nthemselves as to their own past? Are they forms that have become\\nestablished once and for all and have gone on developing through\\ntime? Do they conceal other unities? And what sort of links can validly\\nbe recognized between all these statements that form, in such a familiar\\nand insistent way, such an enigmatic mass?\\nFirst hypothesis – and the one that, at first sight, struck me as being\\nthe most likely and the most easily proved: statements different in\\nform, and dispersed in time, form a group if they refer to one and the\\nsame object. Thus, statements belonging to psychopathology all seem\\nto refer to an object that emerges in various ways in individual or social\\nexperience and which may be called madness. But I soon realized that\\nthe unity of the object ‘madness’ does not enable one to individualize a\\ngroup of statements, and to establish between them a relation that is\\nboth constant and describable. There are two reasons for this. It would\\ncertainly be a mistake to try to discover what could have been said of\\nmadness at a particular time by interrogating the being of madness\\nitself, its secret content, its silent, self-enclosed truth; mental illness was\\nconstituted by all that was said in all the statements that named it,\\ndivided it up, described it, explained it, traced its developments, indi-\\ncated its various correlations, judged it, and possibly gave it speech by\\narticulating, in its name, discourses that were to be taken as its own.\\nMoreover, this group of statements is far from referring to a single\\nobject, formed once and for all, and to preserving it indefinitely as its\\nhorizon of inexhaustible ideality; the object presented as their correla-\\ntive by medical statements of the seventeenth or eighteenth century is\\nnot identical with the object that emerges in legal sentences or police\\naction; similarly, all the objects of psychopathological discourses were\\nmodified from Pinel or Esquirol to Bleuler: it is not the same illnesses\\nthat are at issue in each of these cases; we are not dealing with the same\\nmadmen.\\nOne might, perhaps one should, conclude from this multiplicity of\\nobjects that it is not possible to accept, as a valid unity forming a group\\nof statements, a ‘discourse, concerning madness’. Perhaps one should\\nconfine one’s attention to those groups of statements that have one and\\n\\n~printed_page_number:35~\\n~indexed_page_number:39~\\n\\n36 the archaeology of knowledge\\nthe same object: the discourses on melancholia, or neurosis, for\\nexample. But one would soon realize that each of these discourses in\\nturn constituted its object and worked it to the point of transforming it\\naltogether. So that the problem arises of knowing whether the unity of\\na discourse is based not so much on the permanence and uniqueness of\\nan object as on the space in which various objects emerge and are\\ncontinuously transformed. Would not the typical relation that would\\nenable us to individualize a group of statements concerning madness\\nthen be: the rule of simultaneous or successive emergence of the vari-\\nous objects that are named, described, analysed, appreciated, or judged\\nin that relation? The unity of discourses on madness would not be\\nbased upon the existence of the object ‘madness’, or the constitution of\\na single horizon of objectivity; it would be the interplay of the rules\\nthat make possible the appearance of objects during a given period of\\ntime: objects that are shaped by measures of discrimination and repres-\\nsion, objects that are differentiated in daily practice, in law, in religious\\ncasuistry, in medical diagnosis, objects that are manifested in patho-\\nlogical descriptions, objects that are circumscribed by medical codes,\\npractices, treatment, and care. Moreover, the unity of the discourses on\\nmadness would be the interplay of the rules that define the transform-\\nations of these different objects, their non-identity through time, the\\nbreak produced in them, the internal discontinuity that suspends their\\npermanence. Paradoxically, to define a group of statements in terms of\\nits individuality would be to define the dispersion of these objects, to\\ngrasp all the interstices that separate them, to measure the distances\\nthat reign between them – in other words, to formulate their law\\nof division.\\nSecond hypothesis to define a group of relations between state-\\nments: their form and type of connexion. It seemed to me, for\\nexample, that from the nineteenth century, medical science was charac-\\nterized not so much by its objects or concepts as by a certain style, a\\ncertain constant manner of statement. For the first time, medicine no\\nlonger consisted of a group of traditions, observations, and hetero-\\ngeneous practices, but of a corpus of knowledge that presupposed the\\nsame way of looking at things, the same division of the perceptual\\nfield, the same analysis of the pathological fact in accordance with the\\nvisible space of the body, the same system of transcribing what one\\n\\n~printed_page_number:36~\\n~indexed_page_number:40~\\n\\ndiscursive formations 37\\nperceived in what one said (same vocabulary, same play of metaphor)',\n",
       " ': either\\nbecause, from Bichat to cell pathology, the scales and guide-lines have\\nbeen displaced; or because from visual inspection, auscultation and\\npalpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests, the infor-\\nmation system has been modified; or, again, because, from simple\\nanatomoclinical correlation to the delicate analysis of physiopathologi-\\ncal processes, the lexicon of signs and their decipherment has been\\nentirely reconstituted; or, finally, because the doctor has gradually\\nceased to be himself the locus of the registering and interpretation of\\ninformation, and because, beside him, outside him, there have\\nappeared masses of documentation, instruments of correlation, and\\ntechniques of analysis, which, of course, he makes use of, but which\\nmodify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient.\\nAll these alterations, which may now lead to the threshold of a new\\nmedicine, gradually appeared in medical discourse throughout the\\nnineteenth century. If one wished to define this discourse by a codified\\nand normative system of statement, one would have to recognize that\\nthis medicine disintegrated as soon as it appeared and that it really\\nfound its formulation only in Bichat and Laennec. If there is a unity, its\\nprinciple is not therefore a determined form of statements; is it not\\nrather the group of rules, which, simultaneously or in turn, have made\\npossible purely perceptual descriptions, together with observations\\nmediated through instruments, the procedures used in laboratory\\nexperiments, statistical calculations, epidemiological or demographic\\nobservations, institutional regulations, and therapeutic practice?

In ‘sciences’ like\\neconomics or biology, which are so controversial in character, so open\\nto philosophical or ethical options, so exposed in certain cases to polit-\\nical manipulation, it is legitimate in the first instance to suppose that a\\ncertain thematic is capable of linking, and animating a group of dis-\\ncourses, like an organism with its own needs, its own internal force,\\nand its own capacity for survival. Could one not, for example, consti-\\ntute as a unity everything that has constituted the evolutionist theme\\nfrom Buffon to Darwin? A theme that in the first instance was more\\nphilosophical, closer to cosmology than to biology; a theme that dir-\\nected research from afar rather than named, regrouped, and explained\\nresults; a theme that always presupposed more than one was aware of,\\nbut which, on the basis of this fundamental choice, forcibly trans-\\nformed into discursive knowledge what had been outlined as a\\nhypothesis or as a necessity. Could one not speak of the Physiocratic\\ntheme in the same way? An idea that postulated, beyond all demonstra-\\ntion and prior to all analysis, the natural character of the three ground\\nrents; which consequently presupposed the economic and political\\nprimacy of agrarian property; which excluded all analysis of the mech-\\nanisms of industrial production; which implied, on the other hand, the\\ndescription of the circulation of money within a state, of its distribu-\\ntion between different social categories, and of the channels by which\\nit flowed back into production; which finally led Ricardo to consider\\nthose cases in which this triple rent did not appear, the conditions in\\nwhich it could form, and consequently to denounce the arbitrariness\\nof the Physiocratic theme?\\nBut on the basis of such an attempt, one is led to make two inverse\\nand complementary observations. In one case, the same thematic is\\narticulated on the basis of two sets of concepts, two types of analysis,\\ntwo perfectly different fields of objects: in its most general formula-\\ntion, the evolutionist idea is perhaps the same in the work of Benoît de\\nMaillet, Bordeu or Diderot, and in that of Darwin; but, in fact, what\\n\\n~printed_page_number:39~\\n~indexed_page_number:43~\\n\\n40 the archaeology of knowledge\\nmakes it possible and coherent is not at all the same thing in either case.\\nIn the eighteenth century, the evolutionist idea is defined on the basis\\nof a kinship of species forming a continuum laid down at the outset\\n(interrupted only by natural catastrophes)',\n",

It is\\nconstitutive of the statement itself: a statement must have a substance, a\\nsupport, a place, and a date. And when these requisites change, it too\\nchanges identity. At this point, a host of questions arises: Does the\\nsame sentence repeated very loudly and very softly form one or more\\nstatements? When one learns a text by heart, does each recitation con-\\nstitute a statement, or should one regard it as a repetition of the same\\n\\n~printed_page_number:113~\\n~indexed_page_number:115~\\n\\n114 the archaeology of knowledge\\nstatement? A sentence is faithfully translated into a foreign language:\\ntwo distinct statements or one? And in a collective recitation – a prayer\\nor a lesson – how many statements are produced? How can one\\nestablish the identity of the statement through all these various forms,\\nrepetitions, and transcriptions?\\nThe problem is no doubt obscured by the fact that there is often a\\nconfusion of different levels. To begin with, we must set aside the\\nmultiplicity of enunciations. We will say that an enunciation takes place\\nwhenever a group of signs is emitted. Each of these articulations has its\\nspatiotemporal individuality. Two people may say the same thing at the\\nsame time, but since there are two people there will be two distinct\\nenunciations. The same person may repeat the same sentence several\\ntimes; this will produce the same number of enunciations distinct in\\ntime. The enunciation is an unrepeatable event; it has a situated and\\ndated uniqueness that is irreducible. Yet this uniqueness allows of a\\nnumber of constants – grammatical, semantic, logical – by which one\\ncan, by neutralizing the moment of enunciation and the coordinates\\nthat individualize it, recognize the general form of a sentence, a mean-\\ning, a proposition. The time and place of the enunciation, and the\\nmaterial support that it uses, then become, very largely at least, indif-\\nferent: and what stands out is a form that is endlessly repeatable, and\\nwhich may give rise to the most dispersed enunciations. But the state-\\nment itself cannot be reduced to this pure event of enunciation, for,\\ndespite its materiality, it cannot be repeated: it would not be difficult to\\nsay that the same sentence spoken by two people in slightly different\\ncircumstances constitute only one statement. And yet the statement\\ncannot be reduced to a grammatical or logical form because, to a\\ngreater degree than that form, and in a different way, it is susceptible to\\ndifferences of material, substance, time, and place. What, then, is that\\nmateriality proper to the statement, and which permits certain special\\ntypes of repetition? How is it that one can speak of the same statement\\nwhen there are several distinct enunciations of it, yet must speak of\\nseveral statements when one can recognize identical forms, structures,\\nrules of construction, and intentions? What, then, is this rule of\\nrepeatable materiality that characterizes the statement?\\nThis may not be a perceptible, qualitative materiality, expressed in\\nthe form of colour, sound, or solidity, and divided up by the same\\n\\n~printed_page_number:114~\\n~indexed_page_number:116~\\n\\nthe enunciative function 115\\nspatiotemporal observation as the perceptual space. Let us take a very\\nsimple example: a text reproduced several times, the successive edi-\\ntions of a book, or, better still, the different copies of the same printing,\\ndo not give rise to the same number of distinct statements: in all the\\neditions of Les Fleurs du mal (variants and rejected versions apart)',\n",
       " ': the whole texture of the materiality has changed.\\nBut in this case these ‘small’ differences are not important enough to\\nalter the identity of the statement and to bring about another: they are\\nall neutralized in the general element – material, of course, but also\\ninstitutional and economic – of the ‘book’: a book, however many\\ncopies or editions are made of it, however many different substances it\\nmay use, is a locus of exact equivalence for the statements – for them it\\nis an authority that permits repetition without any change of identity.\\nWe see from this first example that the materiality of the statement is\\nnot defined by the space occupied or the date of its formulation; but\\nrather by its status as a thing or object. A status that is never definitive,\\nbut modifiable, relative, and always susceptible of being questioned:\\nwe know for example that, for literary historians, the edition of a book\\npublished with the agreement of the author does not have the same\\nstatus as posthumous editions, that the statements in it have a unique\\nvalue, that they are not one of the manifestations of one and the same\\nwhole, that they are that by relation to which there is and must be\\nrepetition. Similarly, between the text of a Constitution, or a will, or a\\nreligious revelation, and all the manuscripts or printed copies that\\nreproduce them exactly, with the same writing, in the same characters,\\nand on similar substances, one cannot say that there is an equivalence:\\non the one hand there are the statements themselves, and on the other\\ntheir reproduction.

The sentence ‘dreams fulfil desires’ may\\nhave been repeated throughout the centuries; it is not the same state-\\nment in Plato and in Freud. The schemata of use, the rules of applica-\\ntion, the constellations in which they can play a part, their strategic\\npotentialities constitute for statements a field of stabilization that makes it\\npossible, despite all the differences of enunciation, to repeat them in\\ntheir identity; but this same field may also, beneath the most manifest\\nsemantic, grammatical, or formal identities, define a threshold\\nbeyond which there can be no further equivalence, and the appear-\\nance of a new statement must be recognized.

As has already become clear, I am not trying to say here what I\\nonce tried to say in this or that concrete analysis, or to describe the\\nproject that I had in mind, the obstacles that I encountered, the\\nattempts that I was forced to abandon, the more or less satisfactory\\nresults that I managed to obtain; I am not describing an effective trajec-\\ntory in order to indicate what should have been and what will be from\\n\\n~printed_page_number:127~\\n~indexed_page_number:129~\\n\\n128 the archaeology of knowledge\\nnow on: I am trying to elucidate in itself – in order to measure it and to\\ndetermine its requirements – a possibility of description that I have\\nused without being aware of its constraints and resources; rather than\\ntrying to discover what I said, and what I might have said, I shall try to\\nreveal, in its own regularity – a regularity that I have not yet succeeded\\nin mastering – what made it possible to say what I did. But one can also\\nsee that I am not developing here a theory, in the strict sense of the\\nterm: the deduction, on the basis of a number of axioms, of an abstract\\nmodel applicable to an indefinite number of empirical descriptions. If\\nsuch an edifice were ever possible, the time for it has certainly not yet\\narrived. I am not inferring the analysis of discursive formations from a\\ndefinition of statements that would serve as a basis; nor am I inferring\\nthe nature of statements from what discursive formations are, as one\\nwas able to abstract them from this or that description; but I am trying\\nto show how a domain can be organized, without flaw, without con-\\ntradiction, without internal arbitrariness, in which statements, their\\nprinciple of grouping, the great historical unities that they may form,\\nand the methods that make it possible to describe them are all brought\\ninto question.

In relation to this implicit, sovereign,\\ncommunal ‘meaning’, statements appear in superabundant prolifer-\\nation, since it is to that meaning alone that they all refer and to it alone\\nthat they owe their truth: a plethora of signifying elements in relation\\nto this single ‘signified’ (signifié)',\n",

We are analysing statements, not as\\nbeing in the place of other statements that have fallen below the line of\\npossible emergence, but as being always in their own place. They are\\nput back into a space that is entirely deployed and involves no\\nreduplication. There is no sub-text. And therefore no plethora. The\\nenunciative domain is identical with its own surface. Each statement\\noccupies in it a place that belongs to it alone. The description of a\\nstatement does not consist therefore in rediscovering the unsaid whose\\nplace it occupies; nor how one can reduce it to a silent, common text;\\nbut on the contrary in discovering what special place it occupies, what\\nramifications of the system of formations make it possible to map its\\nlocalization, how it is isolated in the general dispersion of statements.\\n—This rarity of statements, the incomplete, fragmented form of the\\nenunciative field, the fact that few things, in all, can be said, explain\\nthat statements are not, like the air we breathe, an infinite transparency;\\nbut things that are transmitted and preserved, that have value, and\\nwhich one tries to appropriate; that are repeated, reproduced, and\\ntransformed; to which pre-established networks are adapted, and to\\nwhich a status is given in the institution; things that are duplicated not\\nonly by copy or translation, but by exegesis, commentary, and the\\ninternal proliferation of meaning.

To interpret is a\\nway of reacting to enunciative poverty, and to compensate for it by a\\nmultiplication of meaning; a way of speaking on the basis of that\\npoverty, and yet despite it.

In this sense, discourse ceases\\nto be what it is for the exegetic attitude: an inexhaustible treasure from\\nwhich one can always draw new, and always unpredictable riches; a\\nprovidence that has always spoken in advance, and which enables one\\nto hear, when one knows how to listen, retrospective oracles: it appears\\nas an asset – finite, limited, desirable, useful – that has its own rules of\\nappearance, but also its own conditions of appropriation and oper-\\nation; an asset that consequently, from the moment of its existence\\n(and not only in its ‘practical applications’)',\n",

The history of ideas, then, is the discipline of beginnings and\\nends, the description of obscure continuities and returns, the reconsti-\\ntution of developments in the linear form of history. But it can also, by\\nthat very fact, describe, from one domain to another, the whole inter-\\nplay of exchanges and intermediaries: it shows how scientific know-\\nledge is diffused, gives rise to philosophical concepts, and takes form\\nperhaps in literary works; it shows how problems, notions, themes may\\nemigrate from the philosophical field where they were formulated to\\nscientific or political discourses; it relates work with institutions, social\\ncustoms or behaviour, techniques, and unrecorded needs and practices;\\nit tries to revive the most elaborate forms of discourse in the concrete\\nlandscape, in the midst of the growth and development that witnessed\\ntheir birth. It becomes therefore the discipline of interferences, the\\ndescription of the concentric circles that surround works, underline\\nthem, relate them to one another, and insert them into whatever they\\nare not.\\nIt is clear how these two roles of the history of ideas are articu-\\nlated one upon the other. In its most general form, it can be said that\\nit continually describes – and in all the directions in which it oper-\\nates – the transition from non-philosophy to philosophy, from non-\\nscientificity to science, from non-literature to the œuvre itself. It is the\\nanalysis of silent births, or distant correspondences, of permanences\\nthat persist beneath apparent changes, of slow formations that profit\\nfrom innumerable blind complicities, of those total figures that grad-\\nually come together and suddenly condense into the fine point of the\\nwork. Genesis, continuity, totalization: these are the great themes of\\nthe history of ideas, and that by which it is attached to a certain,\\nnow traditional, form of historical analysis. In these conditions, it is\\nnormal that anyone who still practises history, its methods, its\\nrequirements and possibilities – this now rather shop-soiled idea –\\ncannot conceive that a discipline like the history of ideas should be\\nabandoned; or rather, considers that any other form of analysing\\ndiscourses is a betrayal of history itself. But archaeological descrip-\\ntion is precisely such an abandonment of the history of ideas, a\\nsystematic rejection of its postulates and procedures, an attempt to\\npractise a quite different history of what men have said.

But such conservative zeal confirms\\nme in my purpose and gives me the confidence to do what I set\\nout to do.\\nBetween archaeological analysis and the history of ideas there are a\\ngreat many points of divergence. I shall try shortly to establish four\\ndifferences that seem to me to be of the utmost importance. They\\nconcern the attribution of innovation, the analysis of contradictions,\\ncomparative descriptions, and the mapping of transformations. I hope\\nthat by examining these different points we will be able to grasp the\\nspecific qualities of archaeological analysis, and that we may be able to\\nmeasure its descriptive capacity. For the moment, however, I should\\nlike to lay down a few principles.\\n1. Archaeology tries to define not the thoughts, representations,\\nimages, themes, preoccupations that are concealed or revealed in dis-\\ncourses; but those discourses themselves, those discourses as practices\\nobeying certain rules. It does not treat discourse as document, as a sign of\\nsomething else, as an element that ought to be transparent, but whose\\nunfortunate opacity must often be pierced if one is to reach at last the\\ndepth of the essential in the place in which it is held in reserve; it is\\nconcerned with discourse in its own volume, as a monument. It is not an\\ninterpretative discipline: it does not seek another, better-hidden\\ndiscourse. It refuses to be ‘allegorical’.\\n2. Archaeology does not seek to rediscover the continuous,\\ninsensible transition that relates discourses, on a gentle slope, to what\\nprecedes them, surrounds them, or follows them. It does not await the\\nmoment when, on the basis of what they were not yet, they became\\nwhat they are; nor the moment when, the solidity of their figure crum-\\nbling away, they will gradually lose their identity. On the contrary, its\\nproblem is to define discourses in their specificity; to show in what\\nway the set of rules that they put into operation is irreducible to any\\nother; to follow them the whole length of their exterior ridges, in\\norder to underline them the better. It does not proceed, in slow pro-\\ngression, from the confused field of opinion to the uniqueness of the\\n\\n~printed_page_number:155~\\n~indexed_page_number:156~\\n\\n156 the archaeology of knowledge\\nsystem or the definitive stability of science; it is not a ‘doxology’; but a\\ndifferential analysis of the modalities of discourse.\\n3. Archaeology is not ordered in accordance with the sovereign\\nfigure of the œuvres; it does not try to grasp the moment in which the\\nœuvre emerges on the anonymous horizon. It does not wish to\\nrediscover the enigmatic point at which the individual and the social\\nare inverted into one another. It is neither a psychology, nor a soci-\\nology, nor more generally an anthropology of creation. The œuvre is not\\nfor archaeology a relevant division, even if it is a matter of replacing it\\nin its total context or in the network of causalities that support it. It\\ndefines types of rules for discursive practices that run through indi-\\nvidual œuvres, sometimes govern them entirely, and dominate them to\\nsuch an extent that nothing eludes them; but which sometimes, too,\\ngovern only part of it. The authority of the creative subject, as the raison\\nd’être of an œuvre and the principle of its unity, is quite alien to it.\\n4. Lastly, archaeology does not try to restore what has been\\nthought, wished, aimed at, experienced, desired by men in the very\\nmoment at which they expressed it in discourse; it does not set out to\\nrecapture that elusive nucleus in which the author and the œuvre\\nexchange identities; in which thought still remains nearest to one-\\nself, in the as yet unaltered form of the same, and in which language\\n(langage)',\n",
       " ': that is, in the preserved form of exter-\\niority, a regulated transformation of what has already been written.

One can distinguish therefore between two categories\\nof formulation: those that are highly valued and relatively rare, which\\nappear for the first time, which have no similar antecedents, which may\\nserve as models for others, and which to this extent deserve to be\\nregarded as creations; and those, ordinary, everyday, solid, that are not\\nresponsible for themselves, and which derive, sometimes going so far\\nas to repeat it word for word, from what has already been said. To each\\nof these two groups the history of ideas gives a status; and it does not\\nsubject them to the same analysis: in describing the first, it recounts the\\nhistory of inventions, changes, transformations, it shows how truth\\nfreed itself from error, how consciousness awoke from its successive\\nslumbers, how new forms rose up in turn to produce the landscape that\\nwe know today; it is the task of the historian to rediscover on the basis\\nof these isolated points, these successive ruptures, the continuous line\\nof an evolution. The second group, on the other hand, reveals history\\nas inertia and weight, as a slow accumulation of the past, a silent\\n~indexed_page_number:158~\\n\\n158 the archaeology of knowledge\\nsedimentation of things said; in this second group, statements must be\\ntreated by weight and in accordance with what they have in common;\\ntheir unique occurrence may be neutralized; the importance of their\\nauthor’s identity, the time and place of their appearance are also dimin-\\nished; on the other hand, it is their extent that must be measured; the\\nextent of their repetition in time and place, the channels by which they\\nare diffused, the groups in which they circulate; the general horizon\\nthat they outline for men’s thought, the limits that they impose on\\nit; and how, in characterizing a period, they make it possible to\\ndistinguish it from others; one then describes a series of overall figures.\\nIn the first case, the history of ideas describes a succession of events in\\nthought; in the second, there are uninterrupted expanses of effects;\\nin the first, one reconstitutes the emergence of truths of forms; in the\\nsecond, one re-establishes forgotten solidities, and refers discourses to\\ntheir relativity.\\nIt is true that, between these two authorities, the history of ideas is\\ncontinuously determining relations; neither analysis is ever found in its\\npure state; it describes conflicts between the old and the new, the\\nresistance of the acquired, the repression that it exercises over what has\\nso far never been said, the coverings by which it masks it, the oblivion\\nto which it sometimes succeeds in confining it; but it also describes the\\nconditions, which, obscurely and at a distance, will facilitate the emer-\\ngence of future discourses; it describes the repercussions of discover-\\nies, the speed and extent of their diffusion, the slow processes of\\nreplacement or the sudden upheavals that overthrow familiar language\\n(langage)',\n",

Although this description\\n\\n~printed_page_number:158~\\n~indexed_page_number:159~\\n\\nthe original and the regular 159\\nof originalities may seem obvious enough, it poses two very different\\nmethodological problems; that of resemblance and that of procession.\\nIt presupposes, in effect, that one can establish a sort of single, great\\nseries in which every formulation would assume a date in accordance\\nwith homogeneous chronological guide-lines.

But we have also seen\\nthat no statement can be regarded as inactive, and be valid as the\\nscarcely real shadow or transfer of the initial statement. The whole\\nenunciative field is both regular and alerted: it never sleeps; the least\\nstatement – the most discreet or the most banal – puts into operation a\\nwhole set of rules in accordance with which its object, its modality, the\\nconcepts that it employs, and the strategy of which it is a part, are\\nformed.

If it happens to notice an irregularity in the use of words,\\nseveral incompatible propositions, a set of meanings that do not adjust\\nto one another, concepts that cannot be systematized together, then it\\nregards it as its duty to find, at a deeper level, a principle of cohesion\\nthat organizes the discourse and restores to it its hidden unity. This law\\nof coherence is a heuristic rule, a procedural obligation, almost a moral\\nconstraint of research: not to multiply contradictions uselessly; not to\\nbe taken in by small differences; not to give too much weight to\\nchanges, disavowals, returns to the past, and polemics; not to suppose\\nthat men’s discourse is perpetually undermined from within by the\\ncontradiction of their desires, the influences that they have been sub-\\njected to, or the conditions in which they live; but to admit that if they\\nspeak, and if they speak among themselves, it is rather to overcome\\nthese contradictions, and to find the point from which they will be able\\nto be mastered. But this same coherence is also the result of research: it\\ndefines the terminal unities that complete the analysis; it discovers the\\ninternal organization of a text, the form of development of an indi-\\nvidual œuvre, or the meeting-place of different discourses. In order to\\nreconstitute it, it must first be presupposed, and one will only be sure\\nof finding it if one has pursued it far enough and for long enough.

By analysing the truth of proposi-\\ntions and the relations that unite them, one can define a field of logical\\nnon-contradiction: one will then discover a systematicity; one will rise\\nfrom the visible body of sentences to that pure, ideal architecture that\\nthe ambiguities of grammar and the overloading of words with mean-\\nings have probably concealed as much as expressed. But one can adopt\\nthe contrary course, and, by following the thread of analogies and\\nsymbols, rediscover a thematic that is more imaginary than discursive,\\nmore affective than rational, and less close to the concept than to\\ndesire; its force animates the most opposed figures, but only to melt\\nthem at once into a slowly transformable unity; what one then dis-\\ncovers is a plastic continuity, the movement of a meaning that is\\nembodied in various representations, images, and metaphors.

Contradiction, then, functions throughout discourse, as the\\nprinciple of its historicity.\\nThe history of ideas recognizes, therefore, two levels of contradic-\\ntion: that of appearances, which is resolved in the profound unity of\\ndiscourse; and that of foundations, which gives rise to discourse itself.\\nIn relation to the first level of contradiction, discourse is the ideal figure\\nthat must be separated from their accidental presence, from their too\\nvisible body; in relation to the second, discourse is the empirical figure\\nthat contradictions may take up and whose apparent cohesion must be\\ndestroyed, in order to rediscover them at last in their irruption and\\nviolence. Discourse is the path from one contradiction to another:\\nif it gives rise to those that can be seen, it is because it obeys that\\nwhich it hides.

They are objects\\nto be described for themselves, without any attempt being made to\\ndiscover from what point of view they can be dissipated, or at what\\nlevel they can be radicalized and effects become causes. Let us take a\\nsimple example, one that has already been mentioned several times: in\\nthe eighteenth century, Linnaeus’s fixist principle was contradicted,\\nnot so much by the discovery of the Peloria, which changed only its\\nmodes of application, but by a number of ‘evolutionist’ affirmations\\nthat are to be found in the works of Buffon, Diderot, Bordeu, Maillet,\\nand many others. Archaeological analysis does not consist in showing\\nthat beneath this opposition, at a more essential level, everyone\\naccepted a number of fundamental theses (the continuity and pleni-\\ntude of nature, the correlation between recent forms and climate, the\\nalmost imperceptible transition from the non-living to the living)',\n",
       " ': this description takes as its object the visible\\nstructure of organs (that is, their form, size, number, and arrangement\\nin space)',\n",
       " ':169~\\n~indexed_page_number:170~\\n\\n170 the archaeology of knowledge\\nmay be to preexisting forms. By deriving in this way the contradiction\\nbetween two theses from a certain domain of objects, from its delimita-\\ntions and divisions, one does not discover a point of conciliation. But\\nneither does one transfer it to a more fundamental level; one defines\\nthe locus in which it takes place; it reveals the place where the two\\nbranches of the alternative join; it localizes the divergence and the\\nplace where the two discourses are juxtaposed. The theory of structure\\nis not a common postulate, a basis of general belief shared by Linnaeus\\nand Buffon, a solid, fundamental affirmation that throws back to the\\nlevel of a subsidiary debate the conflict of evolutionism and fixism; it is\\nthe principle of their incompatibility, the law that governs their deriv-\\nation and their coexistence. By taking contradictions as objects to be\\ndescribed, archaeological analysis does not try to discover in their place\\na common form or theme, it tries to determine the extent and form of\\nthe gap that separates them. In relation to a history of ideas that\\nattempts to melt contradictions in the semi-nocturnal unity of an\\noverall figure, or which attempts to transmute them into a general, ab-\\nstract, uniform principle of interpretation or explanation, archaeology\\ndescribes the different spaces of dissension.\\nIt ceases, therefore, to treat contradictions as a general function\\noperating, in the same way, at all levels of discourse, and which analysis\\nshould either suppress entirely or lead back to a primary, constitutive\\nform: for the great game of contradiction – present under innumerable\\nguises, then suppressed, and finally restored in the major conflict in\\nwhich it culminates – it substitutes the analysis of different types of\\ncontradiction, different levels in accordance with which it can be\\nmapped, different functions that it can exercise.\\nDifferent types first of all. Some contradictions are localized only at\\nthe level of propositions and assertions, without in any way affecting\\nthe body of enunciative rules that makes them possible: thus in the\\neighteenth century the thesis of the animal character of fossils was\\nopposed by the more traditional thesis of their mineral nature; the\\nconsequences that can be drawn from these two theses are certainly\\nvery numerous and far-reaching; but it can be shown that they\\noriginated in the same discursive formation, at the same point, and in\\naccordance with the same conditions of operation of the enunciative\\nfunction; they are contradictions that are archaeologically derived, and\\n\\n~printed_page_number:170~\\n~indexed_page_number:171~\\n\\ncontradictions 171\\nwhich constitute a terminal state. Others, on the contrary, go beyond\\nthe bounds of a discursive formation, and they oppose theses that do\\nnot belong to the same conditions of enunciation: thus Linnaeus’s\\nfixism is contradicted by Darwin’s evolutionism, but only to the extent\\nthat one neutralizes the difference between Natural History, to which\\nthe first belongs, and biology, to which the second belongs.

In\\nthis ‘world of ideas’, which is in itself so untrustworthy, in which\\napparently the most stable figures disappear so quickly, but in which so\\nmany irregularities occur that are later accorded definitive status, in\\nwhich the future always anticipates itself, whereas the past is constantly\\nshifting, is not archaeology valid as a sort of motionless thought?

Whether as a syn-\\nchrony of positivities, or as an instantaneity of substitutions, time is\\navoided, and with it the possibility of a historical description disap-\\npears. Discourse is snatched from the law of development and estab-\\nlished in a discontinuous atemporality. It is immobilized in fragments:\\nprecarious splinters of eternity. But there is nothing one can do about\\nit: several eternities succeeding one another, a play of fixed images\\ndisappearing in turn, do not constitute either movement, time, or\\nhistory.\\nBut the problem must be examined in greater detail.\\nI\\nLet us take first the apparent synchrony of discursive formations. One\\nthing is true: it is no use establishing the rules in every statement, and\\nthey cannot therefore be put into operation with every statement, they\\ndo not change each time; they can be found at work in statements or\\ngroups of statements in widely separated periods. We have seen, for\\nexample, that for nearly a century – from Tournefort to Jussieu – the\\nvarious objects of Natural History obeyed the same rules of formation;\\nwe have seen that the theory of attribution is the same and plays the\\nsame role in the work of Lancelot, Condillac, and Destutt de Tracy.\\nMoreover, we have seen that the order of statements based on archaeo-\\nlogical derivation did not necessarily reproduce the order of succes-\\nsions: one can find in Beauzée statements that are archeologically\\nanterior to those to be found in the Grammaire of Port-Royal. In such an\\nanalysis, therefore, there is a suspension of temporal successions – or, to be\\nmore precise, of the calendar of formulations.

The linch-pin of Madness and\\nCivilization was the appearance at the beginning of the nineteenth cen-\\ntury of a psychiatric discipline. This discipline had neither the same\\ncontent, nor the same internal organization, nor the same place in\\nmedicine, nor the same practical function, nor the same methods as the\\ntraditional chapter on ‘diseases of the head’ or ‘nervous diseases’ to be\\nfound in eighteenth-century medical treatises. But on examining this\\nnew discipline, we discovered two things: what made it possible at the\\ntime it appeared, what brought about this great change in the economy\\nof concepts, analyses, and demonstrations, was a whole set of relations\\nbetween hospitalization, internment, the conditions and procedures of\\nsocial exclusion, the rules of jurisprudence, the norms of industrial\\nlabour and bourgeois morality, in short a whole group of relations that\\ncharacterized for this discursive practice the formation of its state-\\nments; but this practice is not only manifested in a discipline possess-\\ning a scientific status and scientific pretensions; it is also found in\\noperation in legal texts, in literature, in philosophy, in political\\ndecisions, and in the statements made and the opinions expressed in\\ndaily life. The discursive formation whose existence was mapped by\\nthe psychiatric discipline was not coextensive with it, far from it: it\\nwent well beyond the boundaries of psychiatry. Moreover, by going\\nback in time and trying to discover what, in the seventeenth and eight-\\neenth centuries, could have preceded the establishment of psychiatry,\\nwe realized that there was no such prior discipline: what had been said\\n\\n~printed_page_number:197~\\n~indexed_page_number:198~\\n\\n198 the archaeology of knowledge\\non the subject of mania, delirium, melancholia, and nervous diseases by\\nthe doctors of the Classical period in no way constituted an autonomous\\ndiscipline, but at most a commentary on the analysis of fevers, of\\nalterations in the humours, or of affections of the brain. However,\\ndespite the absence of any established discipline, a discursive practice,\\nwith its own regularity and consistency, was in operation. This dis-\\ncursive practice was certainly present in medicine, but it was also to\\nbe found in administrative regulations, in literary or philosophical\\ntexts, in casuistics, in the theories or projects of obligatory labour or\\nassistance to the poor. In the Classical period, therefore, there were a\\ndiscursive formation and a positivity perfectly accessible to description,\\nto which corresponded no definite discipline that could be compared\\nwith psychiatry.\\nBut although it is true that positivities are not merely the doublets of\\nestablished disciplines, are they not the prototypes of future sciences?\\nBy discursive formation, does one not mean the retrospective projec-\\ntion of sciences on their own past, the shadow that they cast on what\\npreceded them and which thus appears to have foreshadowed them?\\nWhat we have described, for example, as the Analysis of Wealth or\\nGeneral Grammar, thus according them what was perhaps a highly\\nartificial autonomy, was it not, quite simply, political economy in an\\ninchoate state, or a stage prior to the establishment of a truly rigorous\\nscience of language? Is it archaeology trying, by means of a retrograde\\nmovement whose legitimacy it would no doubt be difficult to estab-\\nlish, to regroup in an independent discursive practice all the hetero-\\ngeneous and dispersed elements whose complicity will prove to be\\nnecessary to the establishment of a science?\\nAgain, the answer must be in the negative. What was analysed under\\nthe name of Natural History does not embrace, in a single figure,\\neverything that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries might\\nvalidly constitute a prototype of the science of life, and figure in its\\nlegitimate genealogy. The positivity thus revealed accounts for a num-\\nber of statements concerning the resemblances and differences\\nbetween beings, their visible structure, their specific and generic char-\\nacters, their possible classification, the discontinuities that separate\\nthem, and the transitions that connect them; but it ignores a number of\\nother analyses that date nevertheless from the same period, and which\\n\\n~printed_page_number:198~\\n~indexed_page_number:199~\\n\\nscience and knowledge 199\\nalso outline the ancestral figures of biology: the analysis of reflex\\nmovement (which was to have so much importance in the constitution\\nof an anatomo-physiology of the nervous system)',\n",
       " ': far from anticipating a future biology, Natural History – a taxo-\\nnomic discourse, linked to the theory of signs and to the project of a\\nscience of order – excluded, by its solidity and autonomy, the constitu-\\ntion of a unitary science of life. Similarly, the discursive formation\\ndescribed as General Grammar does not take into account – far from it\\n– everything that could have been said about language in the Classical\\nperiod, and of which the inheritance or repudiation, development or\\ncritique, was to be found later in philology: it ignored the methods of\\nBiblical exegesis, and that philosophy of language as formulated by\\nVico or Herder. Discursive formations are not, therefore, future sci-\\nences at the stage at which, still unconscious of themselves, they are\\nquietly being constituted: they are not, in fact, in a state of teleological\\nsubordination in relation to the orthogenesis of the sciences.\\nShould it be said, therefore, that there can be no science where there\\nis a positivity, and that positivities are always exclusive of the sciences?\\nShould it be supposed that instead of being in a chronological relation\\nto the sciences, they are in fact alternatives? That they are, in a way, the\\npositive figure of a certain epistemological defect. But here, too, one\\ncould find a counter-example. Clinical medicine is certainly not a sci-\\nence. Not only because it does not comply with the formal criteria, or\\nattain the level of rigour expected of physics, chemistry, or even of\\nphysiology; but also because it involves a scarcely organized mass of\\nempirical observations, uncontrolled experiments and results, thera-\\npeutic prescriptions, and institutional regulations. And yet this non-\\nscience is not exclusive of science: in the course of the nineteenth\\ncentury, it established definite relations between such perfectly consti-\\ntuted sciences as physiology, chemistry, or microbiology; moreover, it\\ngave rise to such discourses as that of morbid anatomy, which it would\\nbe presumptuous no doubt to call a false science.\\nDiscursive formations can be identified, therefore, neither as sci-\\nences, nor as scarcely scientific disciplines, nor as distant prefigurations\\n\\n~printed_page_number:199~\\n~indexed_page_number:200~\\n\\n200 the archaeology of knowledge\\nof the sciences to come, nor as forms that exclude any scientificity from\\nthe outset.

You have tried to show that you used neither the\\nmethods nor the concepts of structuralism; that you make no reference\\nto the procedures of linguistic description; that you are not concerned\\nwith formalization. But what do these differences amount to, if not that\\nyou have failed to avail yourself of what is most positive, most rigor-\\nous, and most revealing in structural analysis? That the domain that\\nyou have tried to deal with is not susceptible to this kind of enterprise,\\nand that its richness has constantly eluded the schemata in which you\\nwished to enclose it? And with apparent unconcern, you are now\\ntrying to disguise the impotence of your method; you are now present-\\ning as an explicitly intended difference the unconquerable distance that\\nseparates you, and will always separate you, from a true structural\\nanalysis.\\nFor you have not managed to deceive us. It is true that in the void left\\nby the methods that you have chosen not to use, you have precipitated\\na whole series of notions that seem quite alien to the concepts now\\naccepted by those who describe languages, myths, or works of\\nliterature; you have spoken of formations, positivities, knowledge,\\ndiscursive practices: a whole panoply of terms whose uniqueness and\\n~indexed_page_number:218~\\n\\n220 the archaeology of knowledge\\nmarvellous powers you were proud to point out at every step. But\\nwould you have invented so many oddities if you had not tried to\\napply, in a domain that was irreducible to them, some of the funda-\\nmental themes of structuralism – and those very themes that constitute\\nits most debatable and philosophically dubious postulates? It is as if\\nyou had used not the empirical, serious work of structural analysis, but\\ntwo or three themes that are really extrapolations rather than necessary\\nprinciples.\\nYou have tried to reduce the dimensions proper to discourse, ignore\\nits specific irregularity, hide what initiative and freedom it possesses,\\nand make up for the imbalance that it sets up within the language\\n(langue)',\n",
       " ': you have tried to close this openness. Like a certain form of\\nlinguistics, you have tried to dispense with the speaking subject; you\\nbelieved that one could cut off from discourse all its anthropological\\nreferences, and treat it as if it had never been formulated by anyone, as\\nif it had not come about in particular circumstances, as if it were not\\nimbued with representations, as if it were addressed to no one. Lastly,\\nyou have applied to it a principle of simultaneity: you have refused to\\nsee that discourse, unlike the language (langue)',\n",
       " ': I misunderstood the transcendence of dis-\\ncourse; in describing it, I refused to refer it to a subjectivity; I did not\\ngive primary consideration, as if it ought to be its general form, to its\\ndiachronic character.

On the contrary, my aim was to show what\\nthe differences consisted of, how it was possible for men, within the\\nsame discursive practice, to speak of different objects, to have contrary\\nopinions, and to make contradictory choices; my aim was also to show\\nin what way discursive practices were distinguished from one another;\\nin short, I wanted not to exclude the problem of the subject, but to\\ndefine the positions and functions that the subject could occupy in the\\ndiversity of discourse. Lastly, as you have observed, I did not deny\\nhistory, but held in suspense the general, empty category of change in\\norder to reveal transformations at different levels; I reject a uniform\\nmodel of temporalization, in order to describe, for each discursive\\npractice, its rules of accumulation, exclusion, reactivation, its own\\nforms of derivation, and its specific modes of connexion over various\\nsuccessions.\\nSo I did not wish to carry the structuralist enterprise beyond its\\nlegitimate limits. And you must admit that I never once used the word\\n‘structure’ in The Order of Things. But let us leave off our polemics about\\n‘structuralism’; they hardly survive in areas now deserted by serious\\nworkers; this particular controversy, which might have been so fruiftul,\\nis now acted out only by mimes and tumblers.\\n—It’s no use trying to avoid these polemics: you won’t escape the\\nproblem so easily.

It is quite normal that you should defend the rights of a\\ncontinuous history, open both to the application of a teleology and to\\nthe endless processes of causality; but it was not to protect it from a\\nstructural invasion that failed to recognize its movement, spontaneity,\\nand internal dynamism; in fact, you were trying to preserve the powers\\nof a constituent consciousness, since it was really they that were in\\nquestion.

I am not entirely surprised by it; but I would have preferred\\nto leave it in suspense a little longer. This is because, for the moment,\\nand as far ahead as I can see, my discourse, far from determining the\\nlocus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which it could find\\nsupport.
